<h1 title="">GREEN EYES</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />THE MYSTERIOUS ISLANDER</h2>
<p>It was night on Morton&rsquo;s Bay. A bright
half moon painted a path of silver over
water as still as the night.</p>
<p>At the very center of this narrow bay some
dark object cast a shadow. This was a rowboat.
It was painted black. The anchor lay
in its prow. The boat did not drift. There are
times of perfect calm on the upper waters of
Lake Huron.</p>
<p>One figure was noticeable in this boat. A
slight girl, she sat bent over as if in sleep, or
perhaps in deep meditation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>There was another person in the stern of
the boat. A large girl, she lay in perfect repose
against a pile of pillows. Was she asleep?
Did she dream? She was thinking. One thinks
best when at perfect repose. Where could be
found more perfect repose? Perhaps nowhere.
Yet this girl, who was none other than our
old friend, Florence Huyler, was slightly disturbed.</p>
<p>The rowboat had but now ceased rocking.
The moment before, a powerful speed boat,
passing at a terrific rate, had stirred the waters
and had sent deep ridges and furrows to lift
and drop it, lift and drop it many times.</p>
<p>Florence did not like speed boats. They
hurried too much. She was seldom in a hurry.
She and this other girl had come to the little
settlement to seek repose. More than once
a speed boat had interrupted her meditations.
Now it had happened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking a wide circle,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;More than likely they&rsquo;ll come back.
Why can&rsquo;t they leave us in peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The circle made by the speed boat widened.
Perhaps they would not return after all. Her
thoughts shifted to other matters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>The figure in the forward seat was that of
the blonde French girl, Petite Jeanne. She
had not moved for a quarter of an hour. What
were her thoughts? Or did she think?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she is asleep,&rdquo; Florence told herself.
She had not stirred when the speed boat
rocked them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to warn her if they return?&rdquo; Florence
asked herself. &ldquo;Might topple over into the
bay. She can&rsquo;t swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even as she thought this, Florence
smiled at the idea of danger. What if the
French girl could not swim? One swimmer
was enough. And Florence could swim. Few
better. Once she had swum the Ohio river, a
mile wide, on a wager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to rescue her,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But
then, why get wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered at the thought of a plunge.
It was August, but the season was late. These
northern waters were still cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Once more her thoughts shifted. To her
right she had caught the gleam of a light.
This light suggested mystery. Where the light
shone was an island; not much of an island,
a pile of rocks overgrown with cedars, but an
island all the same. And in the midst of the
cedars, dark, mysterious, all but hidden, was a
cottage. And in the cottage lived a lady who
dressed in somber garments and rowed a black
boat. She visited no one, was visited by no
one, and was seldom seen save in early morning,
or at night. This much Florence had
learned by watching the cabin from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Of all places,
on these northern waters in a community
where no man locks his doors. Mystery! Oh,
well, probably nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all her whispered words, she was convinced
that there <i>was</i> something. She meant
to find out what that something was.</p>
<p>But now her thoughts were rudely broken
off. With a roar that was deafening, the racing
speed boat was once more upon them.</p>
<p>Coming closer this time, it set a current of
air fanning their cheeks and showered them
with fine spray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>The little French girl, waking from her
reverie, stared wildly about her, then clutched
at the seat. Just in time. The rowboat, rocking
violently, threatened to tumble them into
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfish!&rdquo; Florence muttered. &ldquo;As if there
wasn&rsquo;t room enough for both of us in all Lake
Huron!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a question entered her mind. Was
there a purpose in all this? What purpose?</p>
<p>To these questions she could form no answer.
She resolved to remain right there, all
the same; at least until Petite Jeanne had
finished her meditations and asked to be taken
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can so completely fill the mind of
little Jeanne?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Perhaps
it is her part in the play. Ah yes, that must
be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That wonderful play! At once her mind was
filled with bright dreams for the little French
girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne, as you will remember if you
have read our other book, <i>The Gypsy Shawl</i>,
had once lived and traveled with the gypsies
of France. Florence and her friend Betty had
found her there in France. In her company
they had passed through many thrilling adventures.
When these were over, Florence had
invited her to visit America. She had come.</p>
<p>More than that, a marvelous future had appeared
like a bright, beckoning star before her.
In France she had taken part in a great charity
play, staged in the famous Paris Opera. There
she had performed the ancient gypsy dance
in the most divine manner. She had won the
acclaim of the elite of Paris. Not alone this;
she had caught the eye of a renowned producer
of drama. Finding himself prepared to stage
a drama in which the French gypsies had a
part, he had sent to France for Petite Jeanne.
A prolonged search had ended in America. He
had found Petite Jeanne with her friend Florence
Huyler in her own city, Chicago.</p>
<p>The director had laid his plans before her.
Her most important part in the drama was to
be exactly that of her feat in Paris, to dance
the gypsy dance with a pet bear beneath a
golden moon. There were, of course, minor
parts to be played, but this was to be the
crowning glory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would Petite Jeanne do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would she? The little French girl had wept
tears of joy. Since her success at the Paris
Opera she had dreamed many dreams. This
engagement promised to make these dreams
come true.</p>
<p>Only one sorrow had come to her. There
was no part in the drama for Florence.</p>
<p>To Florence this was no deprivation. Acting
had never appealed to her. Life, to her,
was more than acting on a stage. Life, vivid
life, physical strength, the great out-of-doors,
this was her world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when you are rich and famous,&rdquo; she
had said to Petite Jeanne, &ldquo;I will be your
&lsquo;mother.&rsquo; Every star, you know, must have a
&lsquo;mother&rsquo; to protect her from impudent and
stage-struck people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and well you are able to protect me!&rdquo;
laughed Petite Jeanne, squeezing her arm.
&ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> Your arm, it is hard and strong
as a man&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Florence had not waited until the French
girl was rich and famous to become her guide
and protector. She had entered upon the task
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least until she is safely launched upon
her career, and well accustomed to America,
I will stay by her side,&rdquo; she had said to the
great producer, Jeffry Farnsworth.</p>
<p>To this Farnsworth agreed. He at once
made provisions for their immediate needs.</p>
<p>Rehearsals had begun. They proceeded in
a satisfactory manner for three weeks. Then
Farnsworth announced a four weeks&rsquo; breathing
spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go north, where it is cool,&rdquo; he had said to
Florence. &ldquo;Our French lily droops a little in
this humid climate. The north waters and
woods will be medicine to her body and religion
to her soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here they were, drifting on a silent bay,
with the moon and the stars above them and
all the world, save one restless speed boat, at
rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Far back in the bay, on a narrow point
among the pines and cedars, was their temporary
home. A log cabin it was, with a broad
fireplace at its back, with heavily cushioned
rustic chairs in every corner, and with such
an air of freshness, brightness and peace hovering
over it as is found only where sky,
water and forest meet in the northland.</p>
<p>Thinking of all this, Florence, too, had
fallen into a deep reverie when, with the suddenness
of a world&rsquo;s end, catastrophe befell
them.</p>
<p>With a rush and a roar, a demon of speed
sprang at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The speed boat!&rdquo; she screamed in Jeanne&rsquo;s
ear. &ldquo;Jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not out of her mouth when,
with a swirling swing, she was lost in a mountain
of foam. Their rowboat toppled over,
casting them into the chilling water of the
bay.</p>
<p>At once Florence was on the surface, swimming
strongly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what of Jeanne? She does not swim.
I must save her.&rdquo; These were the thoughts
uppermost in her mind when a blonde head
bobbed up close beside her.</p>
<p>Her hand flew out. It grasped something,
the girl&rsquo;s cape. It was loose. It came away.
Jeanne began to sink. One more desperate
effort and Florence had her, first by the hair,
then by an arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Jeanne! Get hold
of my blouse and cling tight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frightened French girl obeyed.</p>
<p>When she had secured a firm hold, Florence
swam slowly. She must have time to think.
The boat was overturned, perhaps smashed.
At any rate she could not right it. The speed
boat had not paused. It was far away. The
night and dark waters were all about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never slackened their pace!&rdquo; she muttered
bitterly. &ldquo;And they laughed! I heard
a laugh. It was a woman. How could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was to be done?</p>
<p>On the shore a single light gleamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the light of that mysterious islander,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;That woman who goes out
only at night. That is by far the nearest point.
We must try for that. It is our only chance.
She must let us in; make a fire; dry us out.
Jeanne will perish of cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she turned her face toward that
light and, swimming strongly, glided silently
through the dark water. The waters were not
more silent than her fair burden, who floated
after her like a ghost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE LADY OF THE ISLAND</h2>
<p>They made a trail in the water, the two
girls, one who swam and one who drifted
after. The trail was short. It appeared to begin
at nothing and end nowhere. The moon
painted it with a touch of silver.</p>
<p>Florence swam steadily. She thought she
knew her powers&mdash;had measured the distance
well. She swam with the determination of one
who prizes life as a precious gift, not lightly
to be held, or carelessly put aside.</p>
<p>Such a girl will go far. But did she fully
know her powers? True, she had gone a
great distance in other waters. But this was
night in the north. The water was chilling.
A sudden cramp, a brief struggle, and their
path of silver would vanish. Only the drifting
boat would speak of the night&rsquo;s tragedy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Florence did not think of this. Possible
tragedies which can in no way be averted are
not worthy of consideration. She thought instead
of the monstrous injustice that had been
done them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they do it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;How
could they? What if they <i>are</i> rich, we poor?
They have no right to override us. What if
their boat <i>is</i> a thing of beauty and power, our
own an old rowboat? The water does not belong
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they laughed!&rdquo; she said aloud.</p>
<p>Jeanne heard and answered, &ldquo;Yes. They
laughed. I wonder why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three boats on the bay like that
one,&rdquo; Florence said. &ldquo;I have seen that many.
Perhaps there are more. Which one could it
have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little French girl did not reply.</p>
<p>Then, because she needed her strength for
swimming, Florence lapsed into silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>To an onlooker the outcome of this adventure
might have seemed questionable. The
water was cold, the distance considerable. To
Florence, endowed as she was with splendid
strength and great faith, not alone in her own
powers but in the Creator&rsquo;s goodness as well,
there was never a question.</p>
<p>Such superb endurance as she displayed!
Hand over hand, arm over arm, she measured
the yards without one faltering movement.
Little wonder, this. Florence regarded her
physical powers as a great gift. She thought
of herself as the Roman maidens did of old.
She was a child of the gods.</p>
<p>So she swam on while the moon looked
down upon her and appeared to smile. And
the graceful, swaying cedars beckoned. At
last, with a sigh of pure joy, she felt her hand
grasp the post of a tiny plank dock, and knew
that her testing was over.</p>
<p>With one last, splendid effort she thrust her
silent companion to a place on the plank surface.
Then she followed.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was completely benumbed
with cold. Her lips were blue. When she attempted
to stand, her knees would not support
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Gathering her in her arms as she might a
child, Florence hurried toward the cottage not
twenty yards away.</p>
<p>The place was completely dark. For all that,
she did not hesitate to knock loudly at the
door.</p>
<p>There came no answer. She knocked again,
and yet again. Still no answer.</p>
<p>She had just placed her shoulder squarely
against the door, preparatory to forcing it,
when a voice demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had an accident.
Boat turned over. We are soaked,
chilled, in danger. Let us in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a sound of movement from
within. Then a heavy bar dropped back with
a slam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>As the door swung open, Florence gasped.
She had seen the occupant of this cottage at
a distance. Since she always dressed in garments
of somber hue and lived here alone,
Florence had expected to find her old. Instead,
there stood before her, holding a lamp
high like a torch, a most dazzling creature.
A young woman, certainly not past twenty-five,
with tossing golden hair and penetrating
blue eyes, she stood there garbed in a dressing
gown of flaming red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Florence, for the time forgetting
her urgent mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her right in,&rdquo; said a strong voice in
a steady, even tone. &ldquo;There are some coals
in the fireplace. I&rsquo;ll soon have it roaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mysterious young lady was as good as
her word. Five minutes had not elapsed ere
a fire was laughing up the chimney. Stripped
of their chilling garments and wrapped in
blankets of the softest wool, the two girls sat
before the fire while their strange hostess
spent her time alternately chafing Petite
Jeanne&rsquo;s feet and hands and tending tea that
was brewing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Florence found time to examine the interior
of the cottage. The bar had been replaced at
the door. As her eyes swept the walls, she was
startled to discover that this cabin was entirely
devoid of windows. More startling still
was her next discovery. At the head of a low
bed, within easy reach of one who slept there,
were two thin, blue steel automatic pistols.</p>
<p>The things fascinated her. She removed
her gaze from them with difficulty.</p>
<p>At that moment it struck her suddenly that
this cabin bore all the marks of a trap. Had
they been dumped out before it by someone
with a purpose? Were they prisoners here?</p>
<p>But why? To this question she could form
but a single answer. And that one seemed absurd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green Eyes!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>There was a young lady, an actress, the star
of Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s cast, who appeared to be intensely
jealous of Jeanne. They had called her
Green Eyes because, in certain lights, her eyes
seemed as green as the sea. Once Florence
had fancied that she had seen her in a speed
boat on these waters. She could not be sure.
Would she stoop to such base plotting? It
did not seem possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; the girl reassured herself, &ldquo;this
cabin is old. It was built for some other purpose.
That it should have its present occupant
is more or less in the nature of an accident.
This woman has a purpose in hiding here. A
mystery!&rdquo; A thrill of pleasant anticipation
shot through her, dispelling fear as the morning
sun dispels the fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery!&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;That
magic word, mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tea is served,&rdquo; said a pleasant voice.
&ldquo;Do you take one lump, two, or none at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-none at all,&rdquo; Florence replied, bringing
herself back to the present moment with a
start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />A GYPSY SECRET</h2>
<p>Hot tea and a blazing fire took the blue
from Jeanne&rsquo;s lips and restored the natural
faint flush to her fair cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say your boat was overturned?&rdquo; Their
hostess abruptly broke the silence that had
fallen upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rowboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Florence hesitated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we should go for it at once. The
wind is rising. It is offshore. The boat will
drift across the bay. I have a rowboat. Perhaps
you would do well to come with me. It
will be something of a task to right it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>She had spoken to Florence. When Petite
Jeanne understood that she was to be left alone
in this windowless cabin, she shuddered ever
so slightly, but said not a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; replied Florence. She turned to
Jeanne. &ldquo;You will be more contented here.
The night air is very cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They departed. Jeanne was alone. When
she had made sure they were out of hearing
distance, she closed the door and dropped the
massive oaken bar in place.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she done this than she found
herself possessed of the idea that someone beside
herself was in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be other rooms,&rdquo; she told herself.
She searched in vain for doors leading
to them. She looked under the bed.</p>
<p>Convinced at last that she was alone, she
looked with wide-eyed interest at her surroundings.
The walls were made of oak paneling,
very well executed and polished to the last
degree. The fireplace was massive. It was
built entirely of the strange honeycomb-like
stone that is found in places along the upper
bays of Lake Huron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why does she live where there is no
light?&rdquo; she asked herself in amazement.</p>
<p>Hardly had she thought this than she became
conscious for the first time of a faint
flush of yellow light lying on the floor at her
feet.</p>
<p>On looking up to discover its source, she
found herself staring at a very broad double
skylight some distance above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like those one sees on the cabins of
ships,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Only higher up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied with her inspection of the place,
she dropped into a commodious chair and at
once fell into a reverie which had to do with
her past and the very near future.</p>
<p>How strange her life seemed to her as she
reviewed it here in the dim lights of such
unusual surroundings!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne, as you well know from reading
<i>The Gypsy Shawl</i>, was born in France.
Her family, one of the country&rsquo;s best, had
been impoverished by the war. The war had
left her an orphan. Possessed only of a pet
bear, she had looked about for some means of
support. A friendly and honorable gypsy,
Bihari, had taken her into his family. She had
learned to do the gypsy dances with her bear.</p>
<p>These she had performed so divinely that
in a contest she had been chosen from many
other dancers to represent the wanderers of
France in a charity pageant to be given at the
Paris Opera.</p>
<p>After many perils, brought upon her by the
green-eyed jealousy of other gypsies, she had
achieved a singular triumph on that great
occasion.</p>
<p>As guests of this pageant, two Americans
sat in a box that night. One was a playwright,
the other a producer.</p>
<p>As the dance progressed, as Petite Jeanne,
seeming fairly to fly through the air, passed
from one movement to another in her bewitching
dance, one of these men touched the other
lightly on the arm to whisper: &ldquo;She is the one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very one,&rdquo; the other had whispered
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>That was all for the time. But now, after
several months, Petite Jeanne, as she sat in
this cabin by the side of a great lake, reveled in
the dream of flitting through her gypsy dance
with two thousand Americans swaying in unconscious
rhythm to her every movement, and
that not one night, but many nights on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nights and nights and nights,&rdquo; she now
murmured, as she clasped her hands before
her.</p>
<p>But suddenly, as if a cloud had fallen over
all, she became conscious once more of dim
light and night. Not alone that. There came
to her now a sense of approaching danger.</p>
<p>The gypsies are curious people. Who knows
what uncanny power they possess? A gypsy,
a very old woman, had in some way imparted
to Petite Jeanne some of this power. It gave
her the ability to divine the presence of those
she knew, even when they were some distance
away. Was it mental telepathy? Did these
others think, and were their thoughts carried
by who knows what power, as the radio message
is carried over the ether, to this girl&rsquo;s
sensitive brain? Who knows? Enough that a
message now came; that it caused her to shudder
and glance hurriedly about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;There must be
gypsies near, French gypsies, my enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even as she said this, the thing seemed
absurd. She had inquired of the native population
concerning gypsies. They did not so
much as know that such people existed. This
section of the country, where the greater part
of all travel is done on water, and where the
people are poor, has seldom been visited by a
gypsy caravan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said with conviction, &ldquo;they
<i>are</i> near!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />WHY?</h2>
<p>There is that about the woods and water
at night which casts upon one a spell of
irresistible loneliness and sadness. It is as if
all the generations of those who have lived
and died in the vicinity, whose canoes have
glided silently through rippling waters, whose
axes have awakened echoes and whose campfires
have brought dark shadows into being,
return at this hour to mourn their loss of a
beautiful world.</p>
<p>Florence felt something of this as the mystery
lady donned a cloak of somber hue, then
pushed a dark rowboat into the water.</p>
<p>A faint knock of oarlock was the only sound
that disturbed the grave-like stillness.</p>
<p>Some dark bird, awakened from his sleep,
rose in their path to go swooping away without
a sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>The lady of the island did not speak. From
time to time she glanced over her shoulder to
sweep the water with her eye. When some
object a little darker than the water appeared
in the distance, she pursued a course that led
directly to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, as they bumped against
the object, &ldquo;is your boat. It doesn&rsquo;t seem
large, nor heavy. You are strong. Perhaps
we can right it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes of muscle testing struggle and
the boat, half filled with water, lay alongside.</p>
<p>As Florence settled back to catch her breath
before assisting in bailing out the boat, she
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can rich people be so thoughtless,
reckless and cruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; said her hostess in a mild tone, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t found them so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they rush our boat, then laugh as
it went over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they? Tell me about it.&rdquo; The young
lady&rsquo;s tone suddenly took on a note of lively
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Florence told her exactly what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is queer,&rdquo; said the lady, as she finished.
&ldquo;Your boat is dark; your friend wore a
dark cape. Until to-night I have spent every
evening for a week in this bay, sitting just as
your companion was sitting, in an attitude of
meditation, you might say. Since you were lying
stretched out in the stern, you would be
practically hidden by darkness. One might
easily conclude that I was the intended victim
of this little joke, if it may be called that, and
that you had stepped in the way of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should they run you down?&rdquo; The
question slipped unbidden from Florence&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>It went unanswered.</p>
<p>They bailed out the boat, took it in tow, then
rowed back as they had come, in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should anyone wish to run you
down?&rdquo; The lady of the island asked this
question quite abruptly the moment they entered
the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Florence remained
silent for a moment before she added, &ldquo;We
have heard that there is an actress visiting the
Eries, those rich people over on the far point.
From the description, it might be Green Eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green Eyes? What a name!&rdquo; The mystery
lady opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not her real name,&rdquo; Florence hastened
to assure her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Jensie Jameson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I have seen her. She is quite marvelous.
But why do you call her Green Eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;re not quite fair to her. She
seems jealous of my friend here. Green-eyed,
as we have a way of saying. Besides, in some
lights her eyes are truly green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green Eyes.&rdquo; The tone of the mystery lady
became reflective. &ldquo;How terrible! What can
be worse than jealousy? Hatred is bad. But
jealousy! How many beautiful friendships
have been destroyed, how many happy homes
wrecked by jealousy. If I were given to that
terrible sin, I should fight it day and night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for this affair&mdash;&rdquo; She changed the subject
abruptly. &ldquo;I think you may feel at ease.
Unless I miss my guess, this bit of misfortune
was not meant for you at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; She swung about. &ldquo;What of
to-night? Your clothes are not dry. I can
loan you some. But are you not afraid to return
to camp at this late hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have little to fear.&rdquo; Florence smiled
in a strange way. &ldquo;We have a bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pet bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you?&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne. &ldquo;Are you not
afraid to stay here alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been afraid.&rdquo; The strange
lady&rsquo;s tone was quiet, full of assurance. &ldquo;Besides,
I trust God and keep my powder dry.&rdquo;
She glanced at the two guns hanging above
her bed. &ldquo;I have no right to be afraid. It is my
business not to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave these on the little dock to-morrow,&rdquo;
she said, as she helped the girls into
some loose fitting house dresses. &ldquo;You will
find your own there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Florence saw the door to
the cabin close as she pushed away from the
dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>A dark bulk greeted them at their own door.
This was Tico, Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s bear, her companion
in the gypsy dance which, they hoped,
was to make her famous. They had brought
him along in order that, alone and quite unmolested
in natural surroundings, the heart of
the north woods, Jeanne might practice her
part in the forthcoming play.</p>
<p>Next morning Jeanne and Tico, the bear,
wandered away into the forest.</p>
<p>Florence went fishing. There is a type of
fishing for every mood. This day Florence
wished to think. Since she was in no mood for
silent meditation she fastened a large spoon-hook
to her fifty yard line, dropped rod and
reel in the bottom of the boat, wrapped the line
about her right hand, then went trolling along
the edge of a weed bed.</p>
<p>The water rippled slightly, the rushes nodded
now and then to a gust of wind. Her oars
made a low dip-dip as she glided across the
water. She did not expect to get a bite. She
was trolling more for thoughts than for fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Into her mind crowded many questions.
Who was the lady of the island? Why did her
blue eyes reflect so much of fearless daring?
Why this strange retreat? Why the automatics
above her bed? Why was she here at all?
There was something about this young woman
that suggested intrigue, crime, possible violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, in such surroundings!&rdquo; She
laughed out loud. &ldquo;Could there be a more
peaceful spot in all the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, could there be? Half a mile
down the bay a tiny village basked in the sun.
A general store, a confectionery, a grocery, a
post office, a few scattered cabins and cottages;
this was Cedar Point. To right and left of her
lay deep bays. Bays and points alike were
dotted with summer cottages, where tired city
people came to rest and fish. Across the bay,
half a mile away, were islands. Four of these
islands were small, one large. There, too, were
cottages. Who lived in those cottages? To
this question she could form only a vague
answer. Two or three were owned by millionaires
with speed boats and yachts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They can have them.&rdquo; She gave her line
a fling. &ldquo;Gas driven things. Bah!&rdquo; Her
splendid muscles set her boat shooting forward.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s better than the good old oars
and a boat that&rsquo;s light and fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, though,&rdquo; she added with a scowl,
&ldquo;that they&rsquo;d leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sent her thoughts off on another tack.
Once more her line was forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people in that speed boat last night
meant to run someone down,&rdquo; she said with
assurance. &ldquo;Question is, who? And why?
Were they after Petite Jeanne? Was it Green
Eyes? Or were they after the lady of the
island? She believes they were after her. But
why were they after her? She didn&rsquo;t tell me
a thing. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden there came a great tug at her
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; she cried, dropping the oars and
snatching at her pole. &ldquo;Got a fish. Wonder
what&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, what a yank!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>She gained possession of her rod in the nick
of time. Not ten feet of line were on her reel
when she seized the handle and held fast.</p>
<p>For a space of ten seconds it seemed the
stout line would snap. Then it went slack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb! Lost him. I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She reeled in furiously. The fish was
coming toward her. Then he whirled about.
As the line went taut again the fish leaped
high out of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pike or a muskie!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I
must have him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A battle royal followed. Now the fish, yielding
stubbornly yard by yard, approached the
boat. Then, catching sight of her, he leaped
away, making the reel sing.</p>
<p>Again she had him under control. Not for
long. A raging demon fighting for freedom
he was.</p>
<p>For fully a quarter of an hour she fought
him until, quite worn out, he yielded, and a
twenty pound muskie shot head foremost into
her landing net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;that I could
come out to mull things over and should catch
such a fish!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, life&rsquo;s that way. I come to think.
I catch a fish. We come here seeking absolute
quiet, and what do we find? Mystery, intrigue,
and all that promises to keep us up late nights
figuring out the next move on the checkerboard
of life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />THE GYPSY CHILD</h2>
<p>In the meantime, accompanied by the lumbering
bear, Petite Jeanne had followed a
narrow way that led to the heart of the forest.
At first her way was along a grass-grown road
that narrowed to a path used in autumn by
hunters. This path at last became only a trail
for wild animals. In a soft marshy spot she
came upon the clean-cut prints of a wild deer&rsquo;s
hoofs and the smaller marks of her fawn.
There, too, she measured the footprints of a
bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small, black brother of yours,&rdquo; she said
to Tico. The bear appeared to understand, for
he reared himself on two legs to sniff the air
and show his teeth.</p>
<p>Leaving this path at last, she climbed a low
hill. There she entered a narrow grass-grown
spot devoid of trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Here, with only the fir and balsam trees
standing in a circle at a respectful distance to
witness, she robed herself in one of those filmy
creations known to Paris alone.</p>
<p>Then, with all the native grace that the
Creator had bestowed upon her, she went
through the steps of that weird dance that was
to be the climax of the drama in which she
had been given a great part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now moonlight at the back of a battlefield,&rdquo;
she whispered softly to herself. &ldquo;This is
a dance to the dead, to the dead who live forevermore,
to those beautiful brave souls who
loved their land more than life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Should one have happened upon her there,
dancing with the bear, he must surely have
been tempted to believe in fairies. So light
was her step, so lissom and free her slight
form, so zephyr-like her flowing costume, so
great the contrast between her and the cumbersome
bear, that she seemed at this moment
a creature of quite another world. Yet this
fairy was capable of feeling fatigue. In time
she wound her filmy gown about her and
threw herself on a bed of moss, to lie there
panting from exhaustion brought on by her
wild gyrations.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Florence, having thought out her problems
as far as she was able to follow them, which
was not far, and having conquered her muskie,
had rowed home, docked her boat and entered
the cabin. She remained for a few moments
indoors; then she reappeared with a basket on
her arm. She took the trail of Jeanne and the
bear.</p>
<p>It was on this same trail that she experienced
a severe shock.</p>
<p>As she trudged along over the moss padded
path, her soft soled sneakers made no sound.
Thus it happened that, as she rounded a clump
of dark spruce trees, she came unobserved
upon a little woodland fantasy played by a
child and a chipmunk. The chipmunk was in
the path, the child at one side. A nut was in
the child&rsquo;s hand, a gleam of desire in the chipmunk&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>The little striped creature advanced a few
steps, whisked his tail, retreated, then advanced
again. The statuesque attitude of the
child was remarkable. &ldquo;Like a bronze statue,&rdquo;
Florence told herself.</p>
<p>The fingers that held the nut did not tremble.
One would have said that the child did
not so much as wink an eye.</p>
<p>For a space of ten minutes that bit of a play
continued. The thing was remarkable in a
child so young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a day over seven,&rdquo; Florence told herself,
as she studied the child&rsquo;s every feature and
the last touch of her unusual attire.</p>
<p>At last patience won. The chipmunk sprang
forward to grasp the nut, then went flying
away.</p>
<p>Did Florence utter an unconscious, but quite
audible sigh? It would seem so. For suddenly,
after one startled upward glance, the child,
too, disappeared.</p>
<p>All uninvited, a startling conviction pressed
itself upon Florence&rsquo;s senses. The child was a
gypsy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>There could be no questioning this. Her
face might have been that of an Indian; her
attire, never. Florence had seen too much of
these strange people to make any mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone that,&rdquo; she told herself, as she
once more took up the trail. &ldquo;Her people have
but recently come from Europe. There is not
a trace of America in her costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; She paused to ponder. &ldquo;We
are near the Canadian border. Perhaps they
have entered without permission and are here
in hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought was disturbing. The tribe of
gypsies with which Petite Jeanne had traveled
so long had many enemies. She had come
to know this well enough when the terrible
Panna had kidnapped Jeanne and all but
brought her to her death. Panna was dead,
but her numerous tribesmen were ready
enough to inherit and pass on her dark secrets
and black hatreds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Petite Jeanne knew there were gypsies
in this forest she would be greatly disturbed,&rdquo;
Florence said to herself with a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After all, what&rsquo;s the good of telling her?&rdquo;
was her conclusion of the matter. &ldquo;Gypsies
are ever on the move. We will see nothing
more of them.&rdquo; In this she was wrong.</p>
<p>She did not tell Jeanne. Together they reveled
in a feast of blueberry muffins, wild honey
and caramel buns.</p>
<p>After Jeanne had gone through her wild
dance once more, they trudged back to camp
through the sweet-smelling forest while the
sunset turned the woodland trail to a path of
gleaming gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />HAUNTING MELODY</h2>
<p>That evening Florence received a shock.
The night before they had, through no
purpose of their own, been thrown for an hour
or two into the company of the young recluse
who lived in a windowless cabin on a shadowy
island. Since this person very evidently wished
to be alone, Florence had not expected to see
her again. Imagine her surprise, therefore,
when, on stepping to the cabin door for a
good-night salute to the stars, she found the
lady standing there, motionless and somber as
any nocturnal shadow, on their own little dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; the mysterious one
spoke. &ldquo;So this is where you live? How very
nice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t come to make a call. I came
for a favor,&rdquo; she hastened to assure the astonished
Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were very kind to us last night.&rdquo; Florence
tried to conceal her astonishment. &ldquo;We
will do what we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but a little thing. I wish to visit an
island across the bay. It is not far. Half an
hour&rsquo;s row. I do not wish to go alone. Will
you be so kind as to accompany me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange request!&rdquo; Florence thought.
&ldquo;One would suppose that she feared something.
And there is nothing to fear. The island
channels are safe and the bay is calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be delighted to go,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>This did not express the exact truth. There
was that about the simple request that frightened
her. What made it worse, she had seen,
as in a flash of thought, the two pistols hanging
over the strange one&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the mystery lady. &ldquo;Get
your coat. We will go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Florence knew that Petite Jeanne was
not afraid to be alone as long as her bear was
with her, she hurried to the cabin, told Jeanne
of her intentions, drew on a warm sweater, and
accompanied the strange visitor to her boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Without a word, the lady of the island
pushed her slight craft off, then taking up her
oars, headed toward the far side of the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What island?&rdquo; Florence asked herself.</p>
<p>There were four islands; three small, one
large. The nearest small one was not inhabited.
She and Jeanne had gone there once to
enjoy their evening meal. There was a camping
place in a narrow clearing at the center.
The remainder of the island was heavily forested
with birch and cedar.</p>
<p>On another small island was a single summer
cottage, a rather large and pretentious
affair with a dock and boathouse.</p>
<p>The large one, stretching away for miles in
either direction, was dotted with summer
homes.</p>
<p>The course of their boat soon suggested to
her that they were to visit the small island that
held the summer cottage. Yet, even as she
reached this conclusion, she was given reasons
for doubting it. Their course altered slightly.
They were now headed for the end where the
growth of cedar and birch reached to the
water&rsquo;s edge and where there was no sign of
life. The cottage was many hundred feet from
this spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When one visits a place by water at night,
one goes to the dock,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Where
can we be going now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rocky shoal extended for some little distance
out from the point of the island. The
light craft skirted this, then turned abruptly
toward shore. A moment later it came to rest
on a narrow, sandy beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will please remain here for a very
few moments,&rdquo; said the lady of the island, &ldquo;I
shall be very grateful to you. Probably nothing
will happen. Still, one never can tell.
Should you catch a sound of commotion, or
perhaps a scream, row away as speedily as
possible and notify Deputy Sheriff Osterman
at Rainy Creek at once. If I fail to return
within the next half hour, do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s answer died on her lips. The
mysterious one was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she? Why are we here? What does
she wish to know?&rdquo; These and a hundred other
haunting questions sped through the girl&rsquo;s
mind as she stood there alone in the dark,
waiting, alert, expectant, on tiptoe, listening
to the tantalizing lap-lap of water on the sandy
shore.</p>
<p>A moment passed into eternity, another, and
yet another. From somewhere far out over the
dim-lit waters there came the haunting, long
drawn hoot of a freighter&rsquo;s foghorn.</p>
<p>Something stirred in the bush. She jumped;
then chided herself for her needless fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some chipmunk, or a prowling porcupine,&rdquo;
she told herself.</p>
<p>A full quarter of an hour had passed. Her
nerves were all but at the breaking point,
when of a sudden, without a sound, the lady
of the island stood beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; she said in a low tone. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were some distance from the island
when at last the lady spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said in a very matter-of-fact
tone, &ldquo;is Gamblers&rsquo; Island. And I am a lady
cop from Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a lady cop!&rdquo; Florence stared at her as
if she had never seen her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady policeman,&rdquo; the other replied quietly.
&ldquo;In other words, a detective. Women now
take part in nearly every field of endeavor.
Why not in this? They should. Men have
found that there are certain branches of the
detective service that naturally belong to women.
We are answering the challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen!&rdquo; She held up a hand for silence.</p>
<p>To their waiting ears came the sound of a
haunting refrain. The sound came, not from
the island they had just left, but from the other,
the supposedly uninhabited one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say&mdash;&rdquo; into the lady&rsquo;s voice there
crept a whimsical note, &ldquo;that this island was
once owned by a miser. He disappeared years
ago. His cabin burned long since. Perhaps he
has returned from another world to thrum a
harp, or it may be only a banjo. We must
have a look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the prow of her boat that way
and rowed with strength and purpose in the
direction from which the sound came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />GYPSY MOON</h2>
<p>As they neared the tiny island, the sound of
banjo and singing grew louder. From
time to time the music was punctuated by
shouts and clapping of hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone playing gypsy under the gypsy
moon,&rdquo; said the lady of the island, glancing
at the golden orb that hung like a giant Chinese
lantern in the sky.</p>
<p>Florence made no reply. She recalled the
dark-skinned child she had surprised on the
trail, but kept her thoughts to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tiny beach half way round to the
left,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;We were here not long
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat swerved. Once more they moved
on in silence.</p>
<p>To Florence there was something startling
about this night&rsquo;s happenings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gamblers&rsquo; Island; a lady cop,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;And now this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more their boat grounded silently.
This time, instead of finding herself left behind,
the girl felt a pull at her arm and saw a
hand in the moonlight beckon her on.</p>
<p>From the spot where they had landed, a half
trail, strewn with brush and overhung with
bushes, led to the little clearing at the center
of the island.</p>
<p>Florence and Jeanne had found this trail
difficult in broad daylight. Yet her guide, with
a sense of direction quite uncanny, led the way
through the dark without a single audible
swish of brush or crack of twig until, with
breath coming quick and fast, Florence parted
the branches of a low growing fir tree and
found herself looking upon a scene of wild,
bewitching beauty.</p>
<p>Round a glowing campfire were grouped a
dozen people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;All French
gypsies!&rdquo; Her heart sank. Here was bad news
indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Or was it bad? &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;they are Jeanne&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the scene boded good or ill, it
enthralled her. Two beautiful gypsies, garbed
in scant attire, but waving colorful shawls
about them as they whirled, were dancing before
the fire. Two banjos and a mandolin kept
time to the wild beating of their nimble feet.</p>
<p>Old men, women, and children hovered in
the shadows. Florence had no difficulty in
locating the child of the trail who had played
with the chipmunk. She was now fast asleep
in her mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s reaction to all this was definite,
immediate. She disliked the immodest young
dancers and the musicians. The children and
the older ones appealed to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have hard faces, those dancers,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;They would stop at nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden a mad notion seized her. These
were water gypsies who had deserted the caravan
for a speed boat. They had seen Jeanne,
had recognized her, and it had been their speed
boat that had overturned the rowboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she told herself instantly, &ldquo;is
impossible. Such a speed boat costs two or
three thousand dollars. How can a band of
gypsies hope to own one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when her strange companion,
after once more pulling at her arm, had led her
back to the beach, she found the notion in full
possession of her mind.</p>
<p>Florence offered to row back to the mainland
but as if by mistake she rowed the long
way round the island. This gave her a view
of the entire shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No speed boat, nor any other motor craft
on those shores,&rdquo; she assured herself after a
quarter of an hour of anxious scanning.
&ldquo;Wonder how they travel, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon she headed for the distant shore
which was, for the time being, their home.</p>
<p>Once again her mind was troubled. Should
she tell Petite Jeanne of this, her latest discovery,
or should she remain silent?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />SUN-TAN TILLIE</h2>
<p>Next day Florence made a new friend.
Petite Jeanne wished to spend the
morning, which was damp and a trifle chilly,
among the cushions before the fire. Florence
went for a ramble in the forest.</p>
<p>She took a path she had not followed before.
These strange trails fascinated her. Some of
them, she had been told, led on and on and
on into vast, trackless slashings where one
might be lost for days, and perhaps never
return.</p>
<p>She had no notion of getting herself lost.
By watching every fork in the trail, and noting
the direction she had taken, she made sure
of finding her way back.</p>
<p>She had been following this trail for half
an hour when of a sudden a voice shattered
the silence of the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Turkey, do be careful!&rdquo; It was a
girl&rsquo;s light pitched voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get
them. You know we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if they ain&rsquo;t here?&rdquo; grumbled a
boy&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they be after?&rdquo; Florence asked
herself. &ldquo;And who can they be, way back here
in the forest where no one lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment. Then, deciding
to investigate, she pushed on.</p>
<p>She was not long in discovering that she
had been mistaken on one count. She was not
in the heart of the forest. The trees thinned.
She found herself on the edge of a bay where
bullrushes were thick. She had crossed a point
of land and had come to water again.</p>
<p>Near the beach, in shallow water, a boy of
twelve and a girl of sixteen were struggling
with a minnow net.</p>
<p>The net was long and hard to handle.
Weeds in the water hampered their progress.
They had not seen Florence. The girl labored
with the determined look of one who must
not pause until her task is completed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The boy was a plain towhead. There are a
thousand such on the shores of the Upper
Peninsula. The girl caught Florence&rsquo;s attention.
She was plump, well formed, muscular.
Her body was as brown as an Indian&rsquo;s. She
possessed a wealth of golden red hair. A single
garment covered her, a bathing suit which
had once been green, but was now nearly
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives,&rdquo; thought Florence. &ldquo;But what
are they after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the girl looked up. She took Florence
in from head to toe at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; Her tone was frank, friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Florence came back. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie&mdash;Tillie McFadden.&rdquo; The girl flashed
her charming Irish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence. &ldquo;Sun-Tan
Tillie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile faded for a second, then returned.
&ldquo;Oh! You mean I&rsquo;m brown. I&rsquo;ve always been
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know girls who&rsquo;d give their best dresses
for your color. They buy it in boxes, and put
it on with a brush, in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. Then she looked at the
net and frowned. &ldquo;Now we lost &rsquo;em! Turkey,
we&rsquo;ve got to get &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s ten autos on
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you catching?&rdquo; asked Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minnies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, minnows? Not many here, are there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s the trouble. Been trying for
more than an hour. Pop, he runs a tourist
camp. Turkey and I catch the bait. It&rsquo;s tough
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over across the point,&rdquo; Florence replied
quickly, &ldquo;there are millions. I saw them half
an hour ago. Water&rsquo;s black with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morton&rsquo;s Bay.&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s face lighted. &ldquo;Turkey,
we got to go there. It&rsquo;s quite a row, but
that&rsquo;s the only place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bring the net across the
point?&rdquo; Florence asked. &ldquo;Let your brother
take the boat around. I&rsquo;ll slip on my bathing
suit and help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; Tillie smiled gratefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to. Must be a lot of fun. All those
minnows tickling your toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be fun for some,&rdquo; said Tillie doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turkey,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;you bring the
boat around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call him Turkey?&rdquo; Florence
asked when they were in the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turkey Trot. That&rsquo;s his nickname. Boys
called him that because they said he ran like
a turkey. He don&rsquo;t mind. Up here everybody&rsquo;s
got a nickname.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said no more, but marched straight on
over the woodland trail. Tillie was strong and
fast. There was no questioning that. She was
in a hurry, too. She led the way, and the city
girl experienced difficulty in holding the pace.</p>
<p>She had dropped a little behind. Tillie was
around a curve and out of sight, when of a
sudden she heard a piercing scream. The next
moment she beheld Tillie nimbly climbing a
tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>The cause was not far to seek. Despite her
efforts at self control, she burst out laughing.
Down the path came a big brown bear. The
bear wore a leather collar set with mother-of-pearl.</p>
<p>When she could stop laughing she screamed
to Tillie: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of him.
He&rsquo;s our pet bear, Tico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Tico, if Tico it be,
marched straight at her. He showed all his
teeth in an ugly snarl. Florence promptly followed
Tillie up the tree. From this point of
vantage she was able to make a more careful
study of the bear and to discover that he was
not Tico after all. He was not as large as
Tico. His collar, though somewhat like Tico&rsquo;s,
was utterly different in design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The final laugh is on me,&rdquo; she said, almost
gayly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Tillie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on me. There&rsquo;s a
tourist party of ten autos coming to our camp.
They&rsquo;ll be there in two hours. They&rsquo;ve got to
have bait. You can&rsquo;t catch minnies in a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>This, Florence admitted, was true. However,
the bear did not keep them prisoners
long. For, after all, he was someone&rsquo;s tame
bear and had eaten his breakfast. After sniffing
at Tillie&rsquo;s net and enjoying its fishy smell,
he ambled off, leaving them to continue their
journey, which they did at redoubled speed.</p>
<p>As they hurried down the trail, one thought
occupied Florence&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;That bear,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;belongs to those gypsies. And
he&rsquo;s nearer our camp right now than the gypsies
have been.&rdquo; She was thinking once more
of Petite Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />BANGING A BEAR</h2>
<p>Arrived at the cabin, Florence hurried
into her bathing suit. All the time she
was changing she was thinking: &ldquo;I only hope
those minnows are still there. Tillie promises
to become an interesting friend. I do not wish
to lose her by a false move now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She need not have feared. The minnows
were there still, flashing in the sunlight.</p>
<p>As Florence appeared with two large buckets,
Tillie cried out in great delight. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get enough for two days! Put the buckets on
the beach. And please hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence followed her instructions, then
seizing one end of the net, plunged after Tillie
into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to fish?&rdquo; Tillie asked, as she executed
a deft curve with the net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love it!&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s tone was full of meaning.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s so little time. There are
boats to bail out, camping places to clean up,
lines to mend, minnies to catch, and a lot more
things. We&rsquo;re never through. Honest, I haven&rsquo;t
had this suit off, except at night, for days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence envied her. She adored the very
tasks this girl had come to hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now!&rdquo; exclaimed Tillie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
&rsquo;em. Just swing your end in; then up with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brown mesh of the net was all ashimmer
with tiny, flapping fishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a shame,&rdquo; said Florence, as she
helped scoop the minnows into one of the
waiting buckets. &ldquo;So many tiny lives snuffed
out just for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t ever get much bigger,&rdquo; said
Tillie philosophically. &ldquo;Pop says they&rsquo;re just
naturally little fellows like some of the rest
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She set the bucket down. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave this
one right here. We&rsquo;ll take the other one down
a piece. We&rsquo;ll get one more haul. That&rsquo;ll be
enough. Then Turkey&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Once more they dragged the net over the
sandy shallows, circled, closed in, then lifted a
multitude of little fishes from the water.</p>
<p>The last wriggling minnow had gone flapping
into the bucket, when suddenly Tillie
straightened up with first a puzzled, then an
angry look on her face.</p>
<p>Seizing a heavy driftwood pole that lay
upon the beach, she dashed away over the
sand.</p>
<p>To her horror, Florence saw that the strange
bear, who had undoubtedly followed them,
had just thrust his head into their other bucket
of minnows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bears like fish,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Tillie will
be killed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie! Tillie!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She may as well have shouted at the wind.
Tillie&rsquo;s stout arms brought the club down
twice on the bear&rsquo;s head. Thwack! Thwack!</p>
<p>With a loud grunt, the bear turned about
and vanished into the brush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>At the same instant Petite Jeanne appeared
at the door. She had heard Florence scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;something tried to steal our minnows,&rdquo;
Florence stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think it
was a dog. Tillie, here, hit him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Tillie, meet my buddy, Petite Jeanne.
She&rsquo;s from France; an actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An actress!&rdquo; Tillie stared at Jeanne as
she might have looked at an angel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
of them,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Florence said in a low tone to
Tillie, &ldquo;that you were afraid of that bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid&mdash;&rdquo; Tillie scratched her head. &ldquo;Yes,
I am. But when I get good and mad, as Pop
says, I&rsquo;m not afraid of nobody nor nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment there came a loud whoop
from the water. It was Turkey Trot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; Tillie shrilled back.</p>
<p>The boat swung in. Tillie, with a bucket in
each hand, waded out to it. The precious cargo
was stowed safely aboard; then seizing the
oars, with a good-bye and thank you, Tillie
rowed rapidly away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to like her a lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of living in a bathing suit, not as a
pose, but as a mere matter of business!&rdquo; she
said to herself some time later. &ldquo;What a life
that must be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne won&rsquo;t know about that bear,&rdquo; she
resolved a moment later. &ldquo;She must not know
about those gypsies. It would disturb her.
And she must rest; must not be disturbed in
any way. Believe me, this being a &lsquo;mother&rsquo; to
a budding actress is no snap. But it&rsquo;s lots of
fun, all the same!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />A GASP IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>That evening Florence, reposing on an
affair of white birch and pillows that was
half chair and half couch, lived for a time in
both the past and the future.</p>
<p>Once more beneath the moon she battled
her way toward the mystery cabin on the
island. Again she stood looking at its strange
interior and its puzzling tenant.</p>
<p>With a vividness that was all but real, she
saw the gleam of black waters as they neared
Gamblers&rsquo; Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gamblers&rsquo; Island,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;A lady
cop. What is one to make of all that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the gypsies? How did they come to
that island? Can it be that they truly have a
speed boat? Did they run us down? Or was
it the young people at the millionaire&rsquo;s cabin,
and Green Eyes?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps neither. It may be that the lady
cop is right; that someone meant to run her
down instead. But who could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought came to her. That day she had
seen a speed boat leave Gamblers&rsquo; Island.
Might there not be reason enough for the
gamblers wishing to run down the mystery
lady?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady cop. What could be more natural?
Gamblers fear detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are there gamblers on that island?&rdquo;
Once more she was up against a stone wall.
She knew nothing of those who lived on the
island. She wished that the lady cop were
more communicative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she will tell me much in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only one thing stood out clearly. In so far
as was possible, Petite Jeanne must be protected
from all these uncertainties and strange
doings. She must have peace and rest. Great
opportunity lay just before her. She must be
prepared for it.</p>
<p>As if reading her thoughts, Jeanne suddenly
sprang to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;that I might practice
my part back there in the forest in the
moonlight. It would help to make it real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; Florence rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, indeed?&rdquo; Jeanne danced across
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Tico!&rdquo; she called, as she danced out
of her bathrobe and into a gaudy gypsy costume.
&ldquo;To-night there is work to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence knew that it required real courage
for Jeanne to take this step. She was afraid
of dark places at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is more spooky than a woodland
trail at night?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>Her admiration for the little French girl
grew. &ldquo;She has real grit,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;She means to succeed; she will do anything
that will aid in making success possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she will succeed! She must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the gleam of a small flashlight, they
made their way, now between tall cedars that
stood like sentinels beside their path, and now
beneath broad fir trees that in the night
seemed dark Indian wigwams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>They crossed a narrow clearing where the
vacant windows of an abandoned homesteader
shanty stared at them. They entered the forest
again, to find it darker than before. The
moon had gone under a black cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; shuddered Jeanne. &ldquo;How quite terrible
it all is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tico rubbed against her. He appeared to
understand.</p>
<p>When at last they came to the little grass-grown
spot where Jeanne was accustomed to
do her bit of acting, the moon was out again,
the grass glowed soft and green, and the whole
setting seemed quite jolly as Tico playfully
chased a rabbit into a clump of balsams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is charming,&rdquo; said Jeanne, clapping her
hands. &ldquo;Now I shall dance as I have never
danced before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Florence, who had witnessed the whole
drama as it was played on the stage, dropped
to a tuft of green that lay in the shadowy path,
and allowed herself to enter fully into the
scene as it would be enacted on that memorable
night when the little French girl should
make her first appearance before an American
audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is night on a battlefield of France,&rdquo; she
whispered to herself. &ldquo;The wounded and dead
have been carried away. Only broken rifles
and two shattered cannon are to be seen.
Petite Jeanne is alone with it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne is a blonde-haired gypsy. Until this
moment she has cherished a great hope. Now
she has learned that the hope is groundless.
More than that, she believes that her gypsy
lover has perished in this day&rsquo;s battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The depth of her sorrow is immeasurable.
One fact alone brings her comfort. She has
still her pet bear and her art, the art of
dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this lonely battlefield, with the golden
moon beaming down upon her, she begins to
do the rhythmic dance of the gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she came to this part of the drama&rsquo;s
story, Jeanne and the bear began to dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is exquisite!&rdquo; she whispered softly. &ldquo;The
moonlight has got into her very blood. If only,
on that great night, she can feel the thing as
she does to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not say more. She did not even
think any more. She watched with parted lips
as the slender girl, appearing to turn into an
elf, went gliding across the green.</p>
<p>The dance was all but at an end when suddenly,
without warning, the big girl was given
a shock that set her blood running cold.</p>
<p>A twig snapped directly behind her. It was
followed by an audible gasp.</p>
<p>At such a time, in such a place, carried away
as she had been by the dramatic picture spread
out before her, nothing could have startled
her more.</p>
<p>Yet she must act. She was Jeanne&rsquo;s defender.
Strangers were here in the night.
Who? Gypsies? Gamblers? Indians?</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet and whirled about
to stare down the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The dance was at an end. Jeanne threw
herself upon the ground, exhausted but apparently
quite unafraid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She did not hear. I must not frighten her.
She may never know.&rdquo; Florence walked slowly
toward her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;It is damp here;
not a safe place to rest. We must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne rose wearily to follow her.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as they made their way
back over the trail they came upon no sign
that anyone had been there besides themselves.</p>
<p>Stranger still, Florence and Jeanne were to
hear of that gasp weeks later, and in a place
far, far away. Of such weird miracles are
some lives made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />A SECRET BEGUN</h2>
<p>Next day it rained. And how it did
rain! The lake was a gray mass of
spattered suds. The trees wept.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was quite content. She had
started to read a long French novel. There
was a box of bonbons by her side, and plenty
of wood for the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not matter.&rdquo; She shrugged her
shoulders. &ldquo;To-morrow the sun will shine
again.&rdquo; At that she lost herself in her book.</p>
<p>Florence enjoyed reading. Sometimes. But
never in the north woods. Each day, every
day, the woods and water called to her. She
endured inaction until lunch time had come
and gone. Then she drew on her red raincoat
and announced her intention of going fishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the rain!&rdquo; Jeanne arched her brows,
then shuddered. &ldquo;Such a cold rain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best time, especially for bass. Rain
spatters the water. They can&rsquo;t see you, so they
take your bait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew a pair of men&rsquo;s hip boots up over
her shoes and knickers, donned a black waterproof
hat, and, so attired, sallied forth to fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sprinkle box is a good place,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<p>John Kingfisher, an Indian, had told her of
the sprinkle box. The sprinkle box belonged
to a past age for that country; the age of logging.
To keep trails smooth, that huge loads
of logs might glide easily to the water&rsquo;s edge,
trails in those days had been sprinkled from a
large tank, or box, on a sled. The water from
the box froze on the trail. This made the
sleds move easily.</p>
<p>When an anchorage for a very large raft
had been needed one spring, a sprinkle box
had been filled with rocks and had been sunk
in the bay.</p>
<p>Since water preserves wood, the box remains
to-day, at the bottom of the bay, as it
was twenty years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You find it by lining a big poplar tree on
shore with a boathouse on the next point,&rdquo;
the Indian had told her. On a quiet day she
had found it. She had seen, too, that some big
black bass were lurking there.</p>
<p>They would not bite; seemed, indeed, to
turn up their noses at her offering. &ldquo;You wait.
I&rsquo;ll get you yet!&rdquo; She had shaken a fist at
them.</p>
<p>So now, with the rain beating a tattoo on
her raincoat, she rowed away and at last
dropped her line close to the submerged sprinkle
box.</p>
<p>Fish are strange creatures. You may make
a date with them, but you never can be sure
of finding them at home at the appointed hour.
A rainy day is a good day for fishing. Sometimes.
The fish of the ancient sprinkle box
very evidently were not at home on this rainy
day. Florence fished for two solid hours. Never
a bite. She tried all the tricks she knew. Never
a nibble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>She was rolling in her line preparatory to
returning home, when, on the little dock on
Mystery Island that led to the lady cop&rsquo;s
abode, she spied a solitary figure. This figure
was garbed from head to toe in rubber hat and
slicker. Like some dark scarecrow, it put out
a hand and beckoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady cop!&rdquo; Florence caught her
breath. &ldquo;What adventure now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She welcomed this promised innovation for
a rainy day. A few strong pulls at the oars
and she was beside the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up,&rdquo; said the lady cop, giving her a
hand. &ldquo;Come in. I must talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s heart leaped. &ldquo;Talk.
The lady cop is about to talk. What will she
tell?&rdquo; She followed gladly enough.</p>
<p>When the bar was down at the door and
they had found seats before the fire, she
glanced about the room. Everything was just
as it had been on that other occasion. The
furnishings were meager; a sort of bed-couch,
a rustic table, some chairs, a fireplace. No
stove. And on the walls, still those two objects,
the automatic pistols. But these did not
seem so strange now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I live here,&rdquo; the young lady began, &ldquo;because
this place fits my purpose. I must not
be known to many. I have told you a little.
No other living soul in this community knows
as much about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even I do not know your name,&rdquo; Florence
suggested quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A name. That means little in the world of
crime and police. The criminal takes a new
name when it suits his purpose. So does a
detective. For the moment I am Miss Weightman.&rdquo;
She smiled. &ldquo;I am not at liberty for
the present to tell you whether or not that is
my true name. And it really does not matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after that she stared moodily at
the fire. Florence respected her very evident
desire for silence.</p>
<p>When at last the lady cop spoke, it was in
a tone deep and full of meaning. &ldquo;There are
days,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;when silence is welcome,
when it is a joy to be alone. Sunshine, shadowy
paths, gleaming waters, golden sunsets.
You know what I mean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But on a dreary day of rain and fog, of
leaden skies, dripping trees and dull gray waters,
one needs a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to be a detective, a lady detective,&rdquo;
Miss Weightman asked quite abruptly,
&ldquo;what sort would you wish to be, the sort
that stays about courts, prisons and parks,
looking after women and children, or one who
goes out and tracks down really dangerous
wrongdoers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d want to go after the bad ones.&rdquo; Florence
squared her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would,&rdquo; her hostess approved.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m after a dangerous one now, a
man who is known from Maine to Florida,
from Chicago to San Francisco. And he&rsquo;s up
here right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last declaration burst upon the girl with
the force of a bombshell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;in a quiet place like this!&rdquo; She could
not believe her ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way crooks have of doing,&rdquo; the other
explained. &ldquo;When they have committed a
particularly dangerous crime, or are in possession
of stolen goods difficult to dispose of,
when the police are after them, they hide out
in some quiet place where you&rsquo;d least expect to
find them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;this location is particularly
advantageous. The Canadian border
is not far away. In a speed boat, it is but
a matter of an hour or two, and you are over
the line. He has a speed boat. He has some
young men with him. Perhaps they are his
sons. Who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this&mdash;&rdquo; she checked herself. &ldquo;This is
starting at the wrong end of my story. It can
do no harm for you to know the facts from the
beginning. I need not pledge you to secrecy.
Through my work I have learned to judge
character fairly accurately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said Florence, charmed by this
compliment from so strange a hostess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />THREE RUBIES</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; said the lady cop, as the toe of
her shoe traced odd patterns in the
ashes before the fire, &ldquo;at times seems very
strange. We are born with certain impulses.
They are with us when we enter the world.
They are in us, a part of our very being. There
is in these very impulses the power to make
or break us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these impulses sometimes takes
the form of a vague longing. We do not always
understand it. We want something.
But what do we want? This we cannot tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As this longing takes form, many times it
discloses itself as a desire for change. We feel
an impulse that drives us on. We wish to go,
go, go. For most of us, extensive travel is impossible.
We have our homes, our friends, our
duties. We do not wander as the Indians and
the Eskimos do. Spring, with its showers and
budding trees, beckons to us in vain. So, too,
does the bright, golden autumn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all, what is at the back of all this
longing but a desire to take a chance? The
savage, roving from place to place, wagers his
very life upon his ability to procure food in
the strange land in which he wanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we, too, at times, feel a desire to make
wagers with life. But we are city-dwellers,
living in homes. No matter. We must take a
chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more wholesome impulse can be found
in a human soul than this. Without this impulse
implanted in a human heart, the New
World would never have been known. Man
would still be dressing in skins, living in caves,
and retiring to his rest by the light of a tallow
dip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desire to take a chance is in every
heart. No one knows this better than does
the professional gambler. He seizes upon
this impulse, invites it to act, and reaps a rich
harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>She paused to throw fresh fuel upon the
fire. There was dry birch bark in it. It flamed
up at once. As the light illumined her intense
face and caused her eyes to glow, she said
with startling suddenness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere there are three priceless rubies.
I must find them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence sat up quite suddenly and stared
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;three rubies!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Not
the words, but the manner in which they had
been spoken, had startled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three large rubies set in a manner so
unique as to make the whole affair well nigh
priceless,&rdquo; the lady cop went on quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, leaning toward Florence,
&ldquo;the thing is Oriental in its design and
workmanship. In fact it came from Japan.
They are clever, those little Japs. This bit of
jewelry is very old. Perhaps it once graced
an Empress&rsquo;s olive brow, or was worn by a
priest of some long lost religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;it is priceless; and these
gamblers have it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Once more she paused to stare at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;that the
finest impulses in life often lead to ruin?
Take that one desire for change, for risking
something we hold dear for some other thing
that lies beyond us. If it is not properly directed,
it may ruin us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No habit ever formed is so hard to break as
the habit of gambling; not even the habit of
excessive drinking. Go ask some man who
has battled both habits after each has become
his master. He will tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, in our cities to-day, boys and girls,
some of them in their early teens, are frequenting
the worst type of gambling houses
and risking all: money, jewels, their very honor,
on the turn of a wheel, the flip of a card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangest of all, they allow some crooked
scoundrel to spin the wheel or flip the card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a girl,&rdquo; she stared hard at the
fire, &ldquo;a very beautiful girl, from a rich and
cultured family, who gambled once and lost.
To-day, in her own sight at least, she stands
disgraced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And because I know her, because she is
kind and good in spite of her father&rsquo;s wealth,
I am striving to help her. For, after all, what
matters most in life is our own estimation of
ourselves. If you feel that your life is ruined,
that you face everlasting disgrace, what does
it matter that the world bows, or even applauds?
It is the judgment handed down from
the throne of one&rsquo;s own soul that counts most
of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl&mdash;she is hardly sixteen, a mere
slip of a thing with wistful blue eyes&mdash;as I
said, belongs to a rich family. They have
a cottage up here on this very bay, I am told,
and she is here now. Yet I have not seen her.
She does not know I am pulling for her, that
I have resolved to retrieve that priceless trinket
and return it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is often that way. While we work,
or play, even as we sleep, there are those in
the world who are thinking of us, striving to
help us, acting the part of fairy godmothers
to us. Is it not wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But these rubies?&rdquo; Florence asked in a
puzzled tone. &ldquo;If those people are so very
rich, cannot they forgive the loss of one valuable
plaything? And did it not belong to
the girl, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Miss Weightman, &ldquo;it did not
belong to the girl. There&rsquo;s the rub. And you
misjudge rich people if you think they do not
prize their least possessions. Perhaps they
prize them more than do the poor or the moderately
rich. That is why they are rich. Their
bump of ownership is well developed. Their
hands and hearts were shaped to grasp and
hold. At times this grows into selfish greed
and thousands of poor people suffer for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three rubies, set in the strangest manner,
were part of a rare collection gathered
from the corners of the earth only after years
of search. It is little wonder that the owner
was indignant when it was broken into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collection was in the girl&rsquo;s home. She
had access to it. In a moment of bravado, at
her chum&rsquo;s suggestion, she slipped about her
neck a chain, to which the jewels were attached
by a sort of pendant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some other fancy seized her and she
promptly forgot the jewels still gleaming at
her throat. A telephone rang. She answered
it, consented to join a party of her school
friends, and was whirled away into one of
those wild nights that too often end in disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gambling place they entered was
Oriental. At least those who appeared to run
it were Japanese men. Back of them was an
American, a professional gambler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I saw that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&mdash;on that island!&rdquo; Florence stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he is the man. But I want him
less than the jewels. I am not on duty. This
is my vacation. I am doing this on my own
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desire for a professional triumph, perhaps.
Besides, as I said, I like the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Getting back to that night,&rdquo; the lady cop
went on after a pause, &ldquo;the place that girl
and her friends entered was one of those that
are quite typical in some big cities. Secret
passages, peculiar knock, and all that. And
then bright lights, whirling wheels, gleaming
balls. All dazzling, and dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little girl gambled with the rest. She
won. The narrow eyes of an Oriental had
spied that priceless pendant. He knew its
value; resolved to play for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time the girl won. Her pockets
bulged with money. Her companions applauded.
She would break the bank. Her eyes
shone. Her cheeks were flushed. Her hands
trembled as she placed her wagers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t break the bank.&rdquo; The lady
cop sighed as she stared at the dying fire.
&ldquo;They never do, except in cheap fiction. Instead,
she began to lose. She lost rapidly.
Soon all her money was gone. Still the mad
gambling craze was upon her. She borrowed
and lost again. She offered her I.O.U. It was
accepted. Once more she lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last she gave up in despair. Then the
Oriental&rsquo;s eyes became mere slits as he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pay.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But how am I to pay?&rsquo; she asked in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His slim brown finger pointed to the three
rubies that gleamed like three red eyes at her
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the first time she had thought of
them for hours. Scarcely knowing what she
did, she unhooked the chain and left the rubies
as a pledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were other places to visit. There
was dancing far into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She awoke at ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning
with a sense of guilt and fear. She thought
of the pendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In horror, she phoned her friends. They
promised to go to the place and redeem the
pledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no longer such a place. In
the night the gamblers had folded their tents
like the Arabs and silently stolen away. They
were in possession of a priceless bauble. They
would make the most of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;was the last seen of
the three rubies in their Oriental setting.
Where are they now? A reward was offered
for their return. No answer. The police and
highly paid private detectives have been on the
trail. They have found nothing. Only last
night I saw the man I suspect. I must make
the most of a great opportunity. I must return
the jewels. Then I will get that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those words sounded strange, coming as
they did from a woman&rsquo;s lips. Yet, as Florence
looked into those flaming eyes she did not
doubt that the lady cop would make good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; She
was destined to ask that question many times
in the days that were to come.</p>
<p>Miss Weightman threw fresh fuel on the
fire and hung a pot of water over it to boil.
Soon they were sipping tea and munching
strangely delicious biscuits.</p>
<p>As they sat listening to the steady beat of
the rain on the skylight of that mysterious
cabin, Florence allowed her eyes to wander
from corner to corner of the place as she
speculated upon the possible motives that
might induce one to erect such a home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May belong to old Indian days,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Or, since we are near the border, it
may have been a smuggler&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of these solutions satisfied her.
She was about to ask the lady cop what she
knew concerning its history, when she heard
the sound of a voice, rising above the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rollin&rsquo; along. Just rollin&rsquo; along.&rdquo; It was
the voice of a girl. &ldquo;Just rollin&rsquo; along. Just
singin&rsquo; a song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;is Sun-Tan Tillie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Sun-Tan Tillie?&rdquo; asked her
hostess with evident interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is Turkey Trot&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Turkey Trot?&rdquo; The young
lady seemed amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are native people here&mdash;run a tourist
camp; rent boats; catch minnows, and all that.
Tillie&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she doing in the rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask her.&rdquo; Springing to the door, she
threw it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yoo-hoo!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Yoo-hoo! Tillie!
What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just rollin&rsquo; along,&rdquo; Tillie came back with
a laugh.</p>
<p>That expressed it. She was out rowing in
the rain. To her inevitable bathing suit had
been added a yellow slicker and a black rubber
hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her to come in and get warm,&rdquo; said
Miss Weightman, joining Florence at the
door.</p>
<p>Florence obeyed instructions. Tillie acquiesced
readily, so the three of them might
soon have been seen sitting before the fire.</p>
<p>They had not talked long before Florence
discovered the motive behind the lady cop&rsquo;s interest
in Tillie.</p>
<p>Tillie had lived here all her life. She knew
every nook and cranny of the islands, points
and bays. More than that, she knew a great
deal about the inhabitants of Gamblers&rsquo; Island
and Erie Point. It was plain to see that this
information was given out freely enough, and
would prove of great service to the lady cop in
her future movements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>But Miss Weightman was not, as you may
have learned, a totally selfish person. A friendship
to her was never one-sided.</p>
<p>There was born in that strange cabin, on
that rainy afternoon, a loyal little club of
three friends: the lady cop, Florence and Tillie,
which was to lead to many a secret meeting,
for the most part in this very cabin, and
many an undertaking which in the end was to
result in benefit to all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />CHARMED DAYS</h2>
<p>For Florence, the days that followed were
filled with glorious adventure. The wind,
the sun, the forest and the water of that north
country have moods for every hour. Florence,
the strong, healthy, joyous child of nature,
had a mood to match each change.</p>
<p>There were days when sky and water were
gray, and the forest full of shadows. At such
times Florence wandered far into the forest&rsquo;s
depths to sit and wonder about many things.
What was this world she lived in? Who had
created it? What were these creatures called
human beings that had been allowed to wander
for a time upon its surface? Why were they
not like horses and dogs and monkeys? Or
were they very different from these, after all?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; she would cry out to the trees
that appeared to ask the questions. &ldquo;They
are different! They think! Think! Do you
think, you trees? Do you think?&rdquo; she would
demand of a whisking chipmunk. The answer
never came except in that still small voice that
was never far away. That voice whispered,
&ldquo;Only men think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sky cleared and the waters sparkled,
she was another person. No problems
came to her then. Enough that she was alive;
that all the world lay spread out before her.
Then all her being called for action.</p>
<p>And to Florence, as long as water was near,
action meant oars and a boat. To her the
very touch of an oar, the lift and fall of a
tossing wave, imparted a magic charm. Her
splendid muscles responded to the touch of
water on the tips of her oars as the robin responds
to the first beam of the morning sun.</p>
<p>Oars, a boat, and away. Sometimes they
entered little land-locked bays where spotted
perch lay fanning the water among the pike
weed. Again, they sought out a great submerged
rock, beneath whose shadows the
black bass lurked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Often, too, they left rod and reel untouched
to watch a mother duck and her young busy
themselves at the task of gathering the day&rsquo;s
supply of young frogs, bugs and snails.</p>
<p>There were wild, windy days, too, that
seemed to shout at the wanton spirit of youth
that was hers. This seemed always a challenge.
Leaving Petite Jeanne to sit by the fire and
dream of her beloved France, she would push
her frail craft off from the shore to battle
winds, waves and foam for hours on end.</p>
<p>As the wind rose and screamed at her, she
would turn her face to it, let her hair fly wildly
out, and scream back in wild defiance.</p>
<p>At such times as these, it seemed to her
that she must have lived before, that for years
on end she had battled winds and waves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>There are those who believe that we live our
lives many times; that in some new form we
return to earth to face life&rsquo;s problems anew.
Florence knew of this belief. As she battled
the elements, it pleased her to assume the role
of a Norseman&rsquo;s bride. In fancy, riding at the
head of some sturdy crew, she faced the battling
waves of the fierce Atlantic and entered
dark caves at night, to sit by a great roaring
fire munching hard bread and venison roasted
over the coals.</p>
<p>Florence Huyler&rsquo;s love of nature amounted
almost to a religion. And who will say that
she might not have found a less desirable subject
for devotion?</p>
<p>What is sweeter and finer than the heart of
the forest, what purer than the soul of a crested
wave?</p>
<p>For Petite Jeanne, too, woods and water
held a great charm. Only her manner of responding
to it differed. She lay for hours on
the warm, sandy beach beneath a great umbrella,
half asleep, dreaming. She, too, wandered
in the forest. From these wanderings
she returned in a pensive mood. These trees,
these winding paths, reminded her of the forests
of France. They whispered all too loudly
of many happy days spent on the edge of those
forests with the gypsies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>On a certain day Florence learned in a forceful
manner just what the little French girl&rsquo;s
feelings were toward the strange people of
her adoption. They were rowing past the end
of a private dock which extended some distance
into the waters of the bay, when Petite
Jeanne suddenly cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh look! Look! Stop! Let me read it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence looked in the direction indicated,
then stared at her in astonishment. She saw
before her only a large post, part of the dock,
which rose some three feet above the water.
On the post was no note, sign or any other
manner of writing that might be read.</p>
<p>Yet Petite Jeanne seized an oar to turn them
about and bring their boat up close to the post.</p>
<p>Then for the first time Florence saw what
had attracted her companion&rsquo;s attention&mdash;three
twigs pinned together by a small nail and
fastened securely to the post.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated this would have seemed
the work of a playful child. To Jeanne it
spoke volumes. Even Florence understood
enough of its meaning to cause her worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now she will know,&rdquo; she whispered to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The three sticks were a gypsy &ldquo;patteran,&rdquo; a
part of the sign language left by these wandering
people at every crossroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne. &ldquo;There are
gypsies about. And oh! they are French
gypsies!&rdquo; She clapped her hands. &ldquo;Only in
France do they make a patteran like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! I will read it. They say they are
three; a man, a woman and a little girl. They
have gone up the bay and will stay to-night at
a small island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence marveled that so much could be
told by three crossed sticks. Still, she did not
doubt the French girl&rsquo;s reading.</p>
<p>Yet more astonishing was Jeanne&rsquo;s attitude
toward the whole matter. She appeared bubbling
over with joy. Such a smile illumined
her face as had not been there for weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jeanne,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;do you not
fear the gypsies? Once you were kidnapped
and nearly killed by them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne spread her hands, then pretended
to blow a feather from her fingers.
&ldquo;That is all long ago. In spirit I am still a
gypsy. And the gypsies live, not for the past,
not for to-morrow, but for this day only. This
day is quite enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added after a moment, &ldquo;I do
not know fear as many do. Gypsies are not
afraid. They love life so much that danger,
even death itself, is forgotten. See! I must
tell you a story; then you will understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />THE DANCE OF DEATH</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In France, at one time,&rdquo; Jeanne began, as
she settled back in her place and Florence
rested on her oars, &ldquo;the gypsies were
treated as outlaws. They were hunted from
province to province. Many were hanged on
trees. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders.
&ldquo;Perhaps this was their own fault.
They may have behaved badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this did not rob them of their love for
life. They danced and sang all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they had rifles and bullets. One
time they had none. A company of soldiers
were stealing upon them through the forest.
They were expected at midnight, when a
young man, Bratu Vaicu, who was in love
with the old chief&rsquo;s daughter, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the time Tinka promised to marry
me.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spoken like a brave gypsy!&rsquo; exclaimed the
chief. &lsquo;Let the wedding go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger meant nothing to these gypsies
when a bridal feast and a dance were at hand.
They kindled fires. The women prepared the
feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stan and Marga decided to be married, too.
Two other couples joined them. Four couples,
four weddings in all. What a night of joy for
a gypsy camp!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cleared a space among the trees. Old
Radu took down his fiddle. He began to sing.
They all started dancing, doing the tarantella,
the most beautiful dance in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the most beautiful,&rdquo; Florence agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shots sounded in the distance,&rdquo; Jeanne
went on, in a tone that was musical, dramatic.
&ldquo;The shots did not disturb the gypsies. Bullets
meant death. But what was death? Were
they not living now as they had never lived
before?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dance grew wilder. Shots came closer.
Bullets whizzed by. Still they danced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A soldier peered through the branches. He
expected to see grim faces and muzzles of
rifles. Instead, he saw laughing eyes and
flashing heels. What did it mean? He did not
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was joined by another, another, and
yet another. A beautiful gypsy girl saw them.
She seized one soldier and drew him into the
dance. Others followed. Soon all the soldiers
were dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning found the soldiers without swords
or rifles. Who cared? They had found true
happiness. They would join the gypsies. And
they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; Jeanne ended with a sigh, &ldquo;by
their very love of life, their disregard for danger
and death, they won more abundant life.
But surely you can see, too, that gypsies are
not really afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither am I. If there are gypsies from
France in these forests, I wish to see them, to
speak their language, to hear them speak my
own beloved tongue. In this strange land we
have a bond of brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that is the way she feels about it!&rdquo; Florence
thought in some surprise. &ldquo;Then I must
find her some gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did find them, and that very soon&mdash;the
same three who had left their patteran on the
dock post. She lost them, too, only to be found
by them long weeks afterward under the most
unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there was the rowboat and
water that was like glass. She rowed on and
on down the bay until the cottages, the store,
the ancient sawmill, the dock, were all but
specks in the distance. Then, with a fir tree
on a point as her guide, she rowed straight for
their cabin.</p>
<p>They ate their lunch on the beach that evening.
Then Jeanne went for a stroll along
the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Florence pushed her boat out into the bay
and rowed toward the open lake. She loved
this spot. No small lake could have so won
her affection. Here in this land-locked bay
she was always safe from storms. Yet, just
beyond, through the gap between two points
of land, she could see Lake Huron. &ldquo;Makes
you feel that you are part of something tremendous,&rdquo;
she had said to Tillie, once. And
Tillie had understood.</p>
<p>Now she dropped her oars and sat there
alone, watching the light fade from the sky
while &ldquo;some artist Saint spilled his paint
adown the western sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was glad to be alone. She wished to
think. Jeanne had a disturbing way of reading
one&rsquo;s thoughts, or very nearly reading
them, that was uncanny. It was of Jeanne, in
part, that she wished to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is positively weird,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;the way exciting happenings keep bobbing up
in this quiet place. Just when I think those
gypsies have left these parts and Jeanne is
free from any harm they might do her, she discovers
that patteran and gets excited about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not expected Jeanne to be so anxious
to see the gypsies. Now she was in a
quandary. Should she attempt to find the
gypsies and bring them to Jeanne? She did
not doubt that this could be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Their camp is just over there,&rdquo; she told
herself, nodding toward the little island that
lay across the bay. &ldquo;But if I find them; if
they meet Jeanne face to face, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could answer this question? Certainly
it was beyond her. There were times when
she felt certain that this gypsy band had come
to America for the purpose of revenge; that
they had somehow secured possession of a
speed boat, had perhaps stolen it, and that it
had been they who tipped over the rowboat
and had come near drowning Jeanne on that
other night.</p>
<p>Just now she was not so sure of this. &ldquo;If
they stole a speed boat they would not dare
remain so long in one place,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;But, after all, what other motive can they
have for remaining in this vicinity?&rdquo; What,
indeed? They were not to be seen at the village,
nor along the shore selling baskets and
telling fortunes as gypsies are accustomed to
do. Yet they did not go away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they did not run us down, who did?&rdquo; she
asked herself for the hundredth time. She
all but hated herself for clinging so tenaciously
to this question.</p>
<p>She thought of the rich people who lived on
Erie Point. At first she had blamed them for
the near catastrophe&mdash;had thought of it as a
cruel prank. The lady cop&rsquo;s opinion of rich
young people had cast a deep shadow upon this
theory. Still she had not wholly abandoned it.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there were the people on
Gamblers&rsquo; Island. The lady cop had said she
believed someone had mistaken their boat for
hers. &ldquo;That would mean that they know she
is after them, and they wish to destroy her,&rdquo;
she reasoned. &ldquo;And yet she hides from them
as if they knew nothing about her. It&rsquo;s all
very puzzling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recalled her latest visit to the lady cop&rsquo;s
cabin. They had been seated by the lady cop&rsquo;s
fire when Tillie said, &ldquo;O-oo! How thrilling to
be the friend of a lady detective!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be thrilling,&rdquo; Miss Weightman had
replied, &ldquo;but you must not forget that it is
dangerous, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous!&rdquo; Tillie had stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The crook, the lawbreaker is sought by the
detective,&rdquo; the lady cop had continued soberly.
&ldquo;Too often the tables are turned. The detective
is hunted by the crook. There is an
age-long war between the law and the breakers
of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such peril,&rdquo; Florence assured herself now,
&ldquo;should be welcomed by every right-minded
person. If being a friend to justice and to
those who uphold the arm of the law puts one
in danger, then welcome, oh you danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while she was thinking these problems
through, she was conscious of a drumming
sound beating in upon her senses. Now
it suddenly grew into a roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another speed boat. And I am alone, far
out at sea,&rdquo; she thought to herself in sudden
consternation as, gripping the sides of her
boat, she braced herself for a sudden shock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The shock did not come. Instead the put-put-put
of a motor ceased and, ten seconds
later, the strangest craft Florence had ever
seen glided up beside her boat. She stared at
it in amazement. The thing was not one quarter
the size of her rowboat; yet it boasted an
outboard motor capable of handling a twenty
foot boat. It had no keel. The prow was flat
as a surfboard. There was one seat, large
enough for a single person. In that seat reposed
a grinning boy of some eighteen summers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The question escaped her
lips unbidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spank Me Again.&rsquo;&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s
grin broadened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She was beginning to feel amused.
&ldquo;It makes a noise like an airplane. But it has
no wings. Looks like a surfboat. But surfboats
don&rsquo;t have their own power. It can&rsquo;t be
a boat because it has no keel. I guess it&rsquo;s a
what&rsquo;s-it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; laughed the boy. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a
who&rsquo;s-it. I&rsquo;m Bradford Erie. My dad&rsquo;s frightfully
rich, so I have to have this thing to advertise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advertise?&rdquo; Florence was puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To advertise the fact that I&rsquo;m just like
everybody else. People think rich folks are
not. But they are. How could they be different,
even if they wanted to? They eat and
sleep, drink, fish, play, fight and go to school if
they are boys. And what does anyone else do?
Exactly the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could like that boy,&rdquo; Florence
thought to herself.</p>
<p>She said to him in a mocking tone, &ldquo;It must
be truly dreadful to be rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a tow back?&rdquo; He changed the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be thrilling, and perhaps a
trifle dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dump you out. I&rsquo;m no rotter.
Give me a try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a try. It was indeed a thrilling
ride. His boat cut the foam as it leaped
from side to side. She got some spray in her
face, and was home before she knew it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With that boy at the wheel,&rdquo; she told herself,
after thanking him and bidding him
good-night, &ldquo;no speed boat would run down a
humbler craft. But then, perhaps he only
mans the &lsquo;Spank Me Again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thing will be the death of him,&rdquo; she
said, as she finished telling Jeanne of this little
adventure. &ldquo;It will turn over when it&rsquo;s
going at full speed. The motor will take it to
the bottom, and him with it.&rdquo; Little she knew
how nearly a true prophetess she was.</p>
<p>That evening Florence sat for some time
before the fire. She was trying to read the future
by the pictures in the flames. The pictures
were dim and distorted. She read little
there. But often the smiling face of the
&ldquo;poor little rich boy,&rdquo; who found it necessary
to advertise the fact that he was just like other
folks, danced and faded in the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real sport,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I
hope we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, with this wish came the
conviction that they would meet again, that
his life and her life, the life of Tillie, of Jeanne,
and of the lady cop, were inseparably linked
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; she told herself skeptically,
&ldquo;this, too, may be but a dream of the passing
flames.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />FISHING AND FIGHTING</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to catch some fish, some
real big black bass?&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s face
shone, as she shouted this to Florence.</p>
<p>Did she? The supreme thrill of a born fisherman,
that which comes from seeing one&rsquo;s
line shoot out sweet and clean, telling of a bass
on the hook, had come to her but three times
in all her young life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I!&rdquo; She seized Tillie and gave her an
impulsive hug. &ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way out. Two miles; maybe
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s two miles?&rdquo; Florence tightened
the muscles of her right arm till they were
hard as stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Tillie. &ldquo;I saw them yesterday;
three big black bass. And were they
black! And big! Long as your arm. Anyway,
half. They all marched out to see my
minnie, like three churchmen in black robes.
They looked, then turned up their noses and
marched right back into the weeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now!&rdquo; Her eyes shone in triumph. &ldquo;I
got crawdads (soft-shell crawfish). Five of
them. And do they like &rsquo;em! You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, in Florence&rsquo;s clinker-built
rowboat, their two pairs of bronzed arms
flashing in perfect unison as they plied four
stout ash oars, they glided down the bay toward
Gull Rock Point.</p>
<p>A second half hour had not elapsed before
they were silently drifting toward the edge of
a weed bed that ran along a narrow point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right there before us,&rdquo; Tillie said in a
low tone. &ldquo;You can see the bullrushes. You
can&rsquo;t see the pikeweed, only a top sticking up
here and there. The pikeweed&rsquo;s got wide leaves
and stands thick on the bottom like a forest.
Fish hide there just as wolves and bears do in
the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the spot.&rdquo; She dropped her anchor
without the slightest splash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You catch &rsquo;em by the back,&rdquo; she whispered,
seizing a crawfish. &ldquo;So they can&rsquo;t pinch you,
you hook &rsquo;em through the tail. Then you spit
on &rsquo;em. That&rsquo;s for luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had performed all these ceremonies,
she tossed her crawfish far out toward
the edge of the weed bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for yours.&rdquo; She adjusted Florence&rsquo;s
struggling crab, then sent him off at another
angle from the boat.</p>
<p>After that she jammed her boy&rsquo;s cap down
over one eye, squinted at the water with the
other, and sat quietly down to wait.</p>
<p>A moment passed into eternity; another, and
yet another. Five minutes, ten, fifteen. The
water lapped and gurgled about the boat. A
slight breeze set the bullrushes murmuring.
A great, green dragon fly came bobbing along
over the water. A sea gull soared aloft, but
uttered never a sound. From his point of vantage,
what did he see? Two girls fishing.
Quite true. But what of the fish? Were those
three bass lying among the weeds? Had they
seen the crawfish?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>It was Tillie who first knew the answer.
The rattler was off her reel. The reel spun
round with no effort and no sound. Suddenly
it stopped.</p>
<p>Tillie placed a thumb on the spool, then
counted in a whisper. &ldquo;One, two, three, four,
five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tip of her pole executed a whip-like motion.
The fish was hooked, the battle begun.</p>
<p>She gave him line. She reeled him in. He
saw the boat and ran. He leaped a full foot
from the water. He came down with a splash.
The line slackened. Was he off? No. One
more wild tug.</p>
<p>And after that a slow, relentless battle in
which the girl won.</p>
<p>The fish lay flopping in the boat, a fine three
pounder. Tillie bent over him, exultant, when
with startling suddenness a voice sounded in
her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you kids! Beat it! This is our fishing
hole.&rdquo; The tone was cold and gruff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Tillie looked up in amazement. Then she
scowled. A trim sailboat, manned by two boys
and a girl, all in their late teens, had glided
silently up to them and dropped anchor.</p>
<p>Tillie fixed her keen blue eyes upon the trio.
All were dressed in silk pajamas and were
smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo; she demanded, as her hands
moved toward an oar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then!&rdquo; The older of the two boys
seized a short pike pole from the deck and
struck her across the back.</p>
<p>To Florence, who looked on, it seemed that
Tillie&rsquo;s red hair stood on end, as she seized
her oar and, using it as a spear, gave the intruder
a sharp thrust in the stomach that
doubled him up and sent him reeling off the
narrow deck into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you little devil!&rdquo; The other youth
turned purple with rage.</p>
<p>All to no purpose. Tillie&rsquo;s oar mowed him
down. He, too, went into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That for all your robbin&rsquo;, gamblin&rsquo; lot!&rdquo;
Tillie screamed.</p>
<p>Then in quite another tone, &ldquo;Up anchor
and away. There&rsquo;s a storm brewing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>They were away before the first of their
adversaries had reached the side of the sailboat.</p>
<p>The shore was not far away. Tillie headed
straight for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to defend our ship,&rdquo; she breathed.
&ldquo;But we lack ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gull Rock Point is a finger of land three
rods wide, a quarter of a mile long, extending
straight out into the bay. Its shores are
moderately steep and composed entirely of
small rocks.</p>
<p>They bumped the shore, threw off their anchor,
caught at overhanging branches, and
climbed to land.</p>
<p>They looked about. The two boys were on
board the sailboat now. They were lifting
anchor and setting sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come after us,&rdquo; said Tillie, in the
calmly assured tone of a great commander.
&ldquo;Load up.&rdquo; She set the example by piling her
left arm with rocks the size of a baseball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot till you see the whites of their
eyes,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Make every shot
count. We can retreat if we must. They&rsquo;d
never find us in the brush. But don&rsquo;t give up
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence once more hung over the bay as the
sailboat glided forward. The rushes whispered,
the dragon fly bobbed and the water
winked in the sun.</p>
<p>The sailboat was a beautiful thing. Highly
varnished it was, and all trimmed in brass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have cost a small fortune,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s
mental comment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re rich. How
does Tillie dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all this there was no thought of disloyalty
to Tillie. She was ready to fight the
affair through at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; shouted Tillie, as the boat drew
near. &ldquo;Come on, and I will give thy flesh unto
the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was a contemptuous laugh.</p>
<p>This angered Tillie still more. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
she screamed, &ldquo;come on, you crooks, you tin
horn gamblers, you&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The names Tillie called her adversaries belong
only to the land of the north. Florence
heard them that day for the first time. We
shall not repeat them here, but utter a little
prayer that Tillie may be forgiven in Heaven.</p>
<p>She punctuated her last remark with a wild
swing of the arm. Not so wild as it seemed,
however, for a stone, crashing against the side
of the highly polished craft, cut a jagged line
of white for fully two feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make
your pretty boat look like a tin can the day
after Fourth of July!&rdquo; A second swing, a second
streak of white down the shiny surface of
brown.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the younger of the two boys took
command. He veered the boat sharply about,
then went sailing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Florence saw that Tillie&rsquo;s
face had gone white. She slumped down
among the rocks to hide her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot!&rdquo; she moaned at last. &ldquo;I got mad,
and I forgot. Now they&rsquo;ll ruin us. Dad told
me not to do it. But I done it all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>After that, for a long time the bay belonged
to the rushes, the ripples and the dragon flies
alone.</p>
<p>Rising at last, Tillie seized the anchor line,
drew the rowboat close in, climbed aboard,
motioned to Florence to do the same, seized
the oars and began to row.</p>
<p>They fished no more that day. Not a word
was spoken until the boat bumped at Tillie&rsquo;s
dock.</p>
<p>Then Tillie, dangling the fine black bass
from the end of a string, said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! You take it. I couldn&rsquo;t eat a bite of
it. It&rsquo;d choke me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;re a brick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE TWILIGHT</h2>
<p>That evening, while the sky was still
pink and the water changing from blue
to purple and then to gold, Florence went for a
row alone. She wanted to think. The events
of that day had stirred her to the very depths.
She had not believed that there were such
persons in the world as those three young
people who had attempted to drive them from
Tillie&rsquo;s fishing hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she told herself. Yet, in
the depths of her heart she knew that this
was not all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie called them crooks, gamblers,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;A professional gambler must
have a cold heart. He takes money in an unfair
way from men who have earned it and
need it. How can one expect to find a warm
heart in the breast of a gambler&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>As she asked herself this question, she
rounded a small island that lay a little way out
from the point upon which the palatial summer
home of Erie, the millionaire, had been
erected.</p>
<p>She barely missed bumping into a canoe
that lay motionless in the water. The canoe
held a solitary occupant, a girl of sixteen.</p>
<p>Instinctively Florence knew that this was
the millionaire&rsquo;s daughter, she who had lost
the three priceless rubies in a gambling den.</p>
<p>Instantly her heart warmed. The girl was
beautiful. She was rich. Yet, on her face
was a look of loneliness and sadness such as
Florence had seldom seen on any face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much the disgrace of losing the
rubies,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;This girl is young.
She is just launching out into life. She has
found it strange and rather terrible. She
doesn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Her first impulse was to pause close beside
the girl, to tell her that she had heard much
about her; that she longed to aid her; that
she and the lady cop would help her; that if
she would but allow it they would explain life
to her; that in the end they would restore the
rubies to their proper place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is rich,&rdquo; thought Florence, with a
quick intake of breath. &ldquo;I am poor. Her
family is in society. I will never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, &ldquo;society,&rdquo; that mysterious something
to which people have given this name.
She did not understand it. There was a barrier.
She must not speak. So she passed on.
And the twilight deepened into night.</p>
<p>She was just turning the prow of her boat
toward the lights of home when a speed boat
came roaring by. Just as they were opposite
her, the searchlight from a larger boat played
for an instant on the faces of those in the speed
boat. She recognized them instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green Eyes, Jensie Jameson, and that boy
who sometimes rides in the &lsquo;Spank Me
Again&rsquo;!&rdquo; she exclaimed beneath her breath.
&ldquo;So she is truly here. Could it have been they
who ran us down that night?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green Eyes, perhaps. But not that boy.
I&rsquo;d trust him anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Yet, even as she thought this, she was
tempted to question her judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;I have placed
every confidence in other persons, and in the
end have found them unworthy. Why not
this boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rowed silently and rather sadly back to
their little dock. Surely this was a puzzling
world. Perhaps, after all, she understood it
as little as the &ldquo;poor little rich girl,&rdquo; back there
in the canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />VOICES IN THE FOREST</h2>
<p>The following day the weather was
threatening. Dark clouds came rolling
down from the north. The biting chill they
brought told that they had journeyed far, from
the very shores of Hudson Bay.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne took one look at the out-of-doors;
then she threw fresh wood upon the
fire, curled up in her favorite chair, and lost
herself in a French romance.</p>
<p>Not so, Florence. For her all days were
alike. Come sunshine, come rain, come heat,
come cold, calm, or storm, it was all the same
to her. The world outside ever beckoned, and
she must go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>This day she chose to wander alone over
unfamiliar trails. As she plunged into the
depths of the forest, she felt the cold and
gloom press in upon her. It did not rain;
yet the trees shed tears. From all about her
came the sound of their slow drip-drip-drip.
A cold mist, sweeping in from the lake, enveloped
all. Now and again, as she passed
through a grove of cottonwoods, a flurry of
golden leaves came fluttering down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Autumn is here,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;We
must be going back soon. But how I long to
stay!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, love you, love you,&rdquo; she sang.
And the song was meant for lake and beach,
forest and stream, alike.</p>
<p>Her trail was long that day. She wandered
so far that she began to be a little frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I find my way back?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>Well enough she knew that before her lay
endless miles of slashings and young timber
which were known only to the wild deer and
the porcupine; that it was quite possible for
one to become lost here for days and perhaps
die of exposure and starvation.</p>
<p>She was thinking of turning back, when to
her great surprise she heard voices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In such a place!&rdquo; she whispered to herself.</p>
<p>At the same moment she noted that the
forest ahead of her had grown thin, that she
could see patches of sky beyond.</p>
<p>Once more she had crossed a broad point
and had come to a strange shore.</p>
<p>But what shore? And who were these people?</p>
<p>Again she paused. As before, she caught
the sound of voices, this time much more distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what a strange language!&rdquo; she thought
to herself.</p>
<p>She concluded that she must be entering
some Finnish settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough,&rdquo; she reassured herself.</p>
<p>For all that, she moved forward cautiously.
Safety first. She was far from her own cabin.</p>
<p>She had just reached a point where, by
parting the bushes, she thought she might be
able to catch a glimpse of the strangers, when,
with the suddenness of an eagle&rsquo;s cry, a scream
rent the air. And after that, another and yet
another. They were a woman&rsquo;s screams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she asked herself, as her
cheeks blanched and the blood seemed to stand
still in her veins. &ldquo;Is this a murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question spurred her to action. She was
young and strong as a man. If someone needed
aid, it was her duty to step out and do her
bit.</p>
<p>With little thought of further concealment,
she moved rapidly through the thin screen of
brush.</p>
<p>Imagine her surprise when, upon emerging,
she saw a man and a woman, gypsies, both
splashing through the lake water to their
waists.</p>
<p>Mystification replaced surprise and fear but
for a moment. It was replaced by sorrow;
for, suddenly stooping beside a great rock, the
gypsy man put out his hand and lifted a small
form from the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low voice,
tense with emotion. &ldquo;Their child! She has
been playing on the rocks. A wave caused by
some passing ship carried her away. Perhaps
they did not notice in time. She may be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Without having seen Florence, the gypsies
waded ashore. There, with a look of infinite
sadness, the man placed the dripping child on
the ground.</p>
<p>The woman joined him. And there they
stood, the two of them, in the bowed attitudes
of those who mourn for the dead.</p>
<p>It came to the girl then that these gypsies,
who had spent all their lives in caravans on
land, knew little or nothing of the water,
which they had apparently adopted as their
temporary home.</p>
<p>No sooner had she thought this than she
sprang into action. Without so much as a
&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; or &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; she leaped forward,
pushed the astonished parents aside,
seized the child and held her, head down, in
the air. Water poured from the child&rsquo;s nose
and mouth. Next, Florence placed her across
the trunk of a fallen tree and rocked her back
and forth. At last she laid her on the ground
and began to work her arms in an attempt
to restore respiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>All this time the gypsies stood looking upon
her as if she might be a goddess or a demon,
sent to restore or devour their child.</p>
<p>Suddenly the child sneezed.</p>
<p>On hearing this, the gypsy woman once
more sent forth a piercing scream, then threw
herself upon Florence&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Shaking herself free, Florence resumed her
work.</p>
<p>A moment later the child began to cry.</p>
<p>A few husky wails from the child, and Florence&rsquo;s
work was complete.</p>
<p>After removing the child&rsquo;s damp clothing,
Florence joined the man in making a fire. She
taught the woman, who had partially regained
her composure, how to chafe the child&rsquo;s hands
and feet; then she prepared to leave them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Jeanne were here,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;I would like to know who they are, where
they came from, and why they are here. So
would Jeanne. But Jeanne is far away. If I
bring her here they will be gone. I cannot
take them to her. Have to trust to good fortune
to bring us together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did she trust in vain?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>If she had seen the look on that woman&rsquo;s
face as she once more vanished into the forest,
she would have known certainly that in this
world there was one person who would, if fate
required it, go to the gallows or the electric
chair for her.</p>
<p>Thus does fate play with the children of
men. She casts before them golden opportunities.
If they prove themselves steadfast, true
and fearless, in her own good time, in some
far future it may be, in ways of which they
do not dream, she sends her reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />REVERIES</h2>
<p>Florence had not lost herself in the forest.
Though she had not the slightest notion
what shore she stood on at the time she
brought the gypsy child back to life, she experienced
little difficulty in finding her way
back to her cabin.</p>
<p>Two hours had not elapsed when once more
she sat before her own fire, drinking strong
coffee and relating her adventure to Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the poor gypsy child!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed
as she finished. &ldquo;Out in such weather.
And after such an adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their camp must have been very near,&rdquo;
replied Florence. &ldquo;And you know well enough
that the gypsies can arrange a cozy camp out
of less than nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, yes, surely that is so!&rdquo; exclaimed
the little French girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how unkind fate is.&rdquo; Her tone changed.
She became sad. &ldquo;Here I am pining my heart
away for one look at some gypsy friends. And
all I see is three tiny twigs they have touched,
their patteran, while you, who care so little,
meet them at every turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the storm is over,&rdquo; Florence sought
to console her, &ldquo;we will row over to that island
where we saw their camp. Perhaps they are
still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not be.&rdquo; Jeanne refused to be
comforted. &ldquo;Always they are on the move.
When one meets them, the proper thing to say
is, &lsquo;Where do you come from to-day? Where
do you go to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange these gypsies are!&rdquo; Jeanne
mused after a moment of silence. &ldquo;Always
they are on islands and on points of land
where there are no roads. They travel by
water. Water gypsies. How quite novel that
is! And yet, in southern France there are
some such people. There are villages where
all the fisher-folk are gypsies. Brave and daring
seamen they are, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, very brave. You must not think
that gypsies are cowards. Gypsies fought in
the great war, fought and died. Ah, yes! So
you see this beautiful story of the stage, this
play in which I am to have so wonderful a
part, this tale of gypsies in war, is not without
its parallel in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she lapsed into silence. She was
thinking again of that night, which each sunset
found a day nearer, when on an American
stage, before many hundreds of people, she
should dance the gypsy tarantella on a miniature
battlefield beneath the light of an imaginary
moon.</p>
<p>At such times as this, Florence loved to
watch the changes that passed over Jeanne&rsquo;s
face. As she imagined herself in the wings,
awaiting her cue, a look of uncertainty, almost
of fear, was written there. As, still in her
imagination, she stepped out to face her
audience, a wistful expression banished fear.
After that, as she entered into the compelling
rhythm of the dance, came complete transformation.
Her face, warmed as if by the mellow
light of the morning sun, became the face of
a Madonna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; Florence thought to herself,
&ldquo;that the play proves a great success. It means
so much to her. And she is so kind-hearted,
so unspoiled. She has lost so much; has so
much to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the rain!&rdquo; cried Jeanne. &ldquo;Who
would believe it could come down so hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days&rsquo; rain. That&rsquo;s what the old
timers say it will be. We have so little time
to spend here. And there is so much that
might be done.&rdquo; Florence sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she spoke again, after
watching the glow of the fire and listening
to the steady patter-patter on the roof, &ldquo;living
in a place like this affects me strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>She stretched herself full length in the great
cedar chair. &ldquo;I feel as if I had always lived
here, never been out of the woods; as if I were
very poor, ignorant and strong. I find it hard
to believe that I have warm, soft, bright garments
of fine spun cotton and silk. It is as if
my garments had always been of brown homespun,
my boots of coarsest leather, my hat of
rain-proof stuff; as if I tramped days and days
over miles of trail that would weary city-dwellers,
but can only bring fresh joy to the
one of browned features and brawny limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; she cried with some passion,
sitting up quite abruptly. &ldquo;Why not a
cabin like this, and peace? In winter the trap
line, a long, long tramp in high boots through
drifted snow. A weasel pelt here, a mink there,
and by this pond muskrat skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And out over the lake&rsquo;s four foot ice, far
across the frozen inland sea to Goose Island.
There a fish shanty, a hole in the ice, twenty
fathoms of line and a rich catch of lake trout
and sturgeon. Why not always at night the
crackling fire, the bacon and corn bread eaten
with a relish because one is truly hungry?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? No worry about room rent, a
run in a silk stocking or a frayed Sunday
dress. Why not always boots of cowhide and
coats of canvas that do not wear out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but after all you are a girl,&rdquo; smiled
Petite Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this day,&rdquo; said Florence with great emphasis,
&ldquo;that does not matter. All that matters
is that I am as strong as a man; that if
I choose I can follow a man&rsquo;s trap line or fish
in a man&rsquo;s shanty over the frozen lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not all.&rdquo; The French girl&rsquo;s tone was
quiet, full of assurance. &ldquo;Women are born
with a desire for beauty, softness and color.
We live for that which we see and touch; your
eye catches the glorious red, the orange, the
blue of a gown, and it enchants you. Is it not
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but here at the edge of the lake we
have the sunset. What could be more gorgeous?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! But that you cannot touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never note?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone grew
serious. &ldquo;Did you never come to realize how
much we live for the sense of touch? A scarf
of silken gold is held out before you. You say,
&lsquo;Let me see it.&rsquo; But you hold out a hand.
Why? You wish to touch it. You have missed
a friend for a long time. She returns. Your
hands, your lips, meet. Why? Because you
are not happy until you have touched the one
you love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Miss Florence! This is very wonderful,
very peaceful. It is so very grand. But
after all, it is only for now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, next day, sometime very soon
you are going to hear the call of the city, to
feel its pull at your heart. All the bright lights,
the colors, the shouts, the throngs will call to
you. And you will go. For there, after all, is
life. Life&mdash;beautiful, rushing, throbbing life.
That, my dear friend, is a city. It is found nowhere
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping from her chair, the little French
girl went whirling across the floor in her fantastic
dance. She danced herself quite out of
the cabin and out into the rain, leaving Florence
to meditate upon her strange words, to
conclude that Jeanne was more than half
right, then to spring suddenly to her feet, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, Petite Jeanne! Come back
right now. You will die of pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ever hear of a sprite dying of pneumonia?&rdquo;
Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes were as full of laughter as her
golden locks were of water, as she came dancing
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a sprite,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;Even
if you were one, who had taken human form,
I&rsquo;d have to keep you human until that play
had its run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the blessed play!&rdquo; said the French girl
contritely, at the same time snatching at her
drenched garments. &ldquo;How one does hate being
in training for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, wrapped in a white,
woolly blanket, she sat toasting before a fire.
At this moment everything, past and future,
was forgotten in the glorious now.</p>

<br />THE STOLEN TRUNK</h2>
<p>The three days&rsquo; rain became a reality. A
steady downpour, that set the forest
mourning in earnest and turned the lake into
a blanket of gray, settled down over all.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne did not care. She had been
sent north to rest. There was still a pile of
unread romances in the corner cupboard. The
shed at the back of the cabin was piled high
with dry wood. The fire burned ever brightly.
What more could she wish?</p>
<p>When she tired of reading she called to Tico,
who lay sleeping by the fire hours on end, and
together they went through some difficult step
of the gypsy dance.</p>
<p>To Florence, save for one condition, this
prolonged downpour would have seemed nothing
short of a catastrophe. She was shut away
from her beloved out-of-doors, but this only
gave her more time to spend with that fascinating
person, the lady cop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>The lady cop had become all but a pal to
Florence and Tillie. Every evening, after the
day&rsquo;s work was done and darkness had blanketed
the water, Tillie came stealing over to
the mystery cabin.</p>
<p>And she never lacked a welcome. She gave
the lady cop many a needed bit of information.
With her aid, the lady cop had so far progressed
in her investigation that she whispered
to them on the second day of the rain that
soon she would be ready to wire for re&euml;nforcements.
When these arrived she would
spring the trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Florence breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the three rubies will be in my hands.
And someone will go to jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not talk too much,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;The best laid plans fail often enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour of the day that Florence and Tillie
loved best was the one which preceded the lady
cop&rsquo;s shooing them out for the night. At that
hour, after brewing herself a cup of coffee and
drinking it steaming hot, she spun weird tales
of her adventures as a lady detective.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>An only child of a police captain, at the age
of eighteen she had seen her father brought
home dead, shot in the back while assisting in
a raid on a notorious gambling house. Over
her father&rsquo;s dead body she had vowed that she
would take his place.</p>
<p>When the time came, when she was of age,
her mother, having no boys to give to the great
service of protecting humanity, had smilingly,
tearfully, given that which she had, a girl.
And to the city she had already proved herself
a priceless gift.</p>
<p>Working her way secretly into places where
no man could ever have entered, she had
brought to light places of vice and crime which
for long years had remained hidden in the
dark.</p>
<p>Time and again she had succeeded in attaching
herself to some wild young set, and in so
doing had not alone shown them their folly,
but had also brought those who preyed upon
them to justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always easy to place money on the
board,&rdquo; she said one night, &ldquo;on the gaming
board, with a hand that does not tremble, when
you realize that there are those watching who
would gladly kill you, did they but know who
you were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice I was discovered and locked up.
One of these times I let myself out of the window
to the street two floors below on a rope
made of my own skirt. The other time a squad
wagon came in time to release me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to this!&rdquo; Her eyes burned brightly.
&ldquo;Never believe the stories you read in cheap
magazines. These stories tell you that crooks
are really good sports, generous, chivalrous
and all that. They are not&mdash;not one in a thousand.
They are hard as flint; cruel, heartless,
ready for any savage deed that will give them
liberty and the wild life they crave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this outburst on that second rainy
night, she lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>In time she sprang to her feet and drew on
her raincoat. &ldquo;I am going out for a row alone
in the dark,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Stay here and keep
the fire burning. It&rsquo;s not late. I&rsquo;ll be back in
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>She left the cabin. Tillie and Florence sat
by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever hear how this cabin came here?&rdquo; Tillie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence replied quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of interesting. I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Please do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Tillie began, &ldquo;was once the cabin
of a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks the part,&rdquo; replied Florence. &ldquo;But
where are the portholes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has covered them.&rdquo; Tillie stepped
to the wall, fumbled for a short time with a
fastening, then swung back a section of the
paneling which was, in reality, a small door,
revealing a circle of brass framing a glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why a ship&rsquo;s cabin on land?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s
face took on a puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all on account of old Captain Abner
Jones. His ship was wrecked on the shoals
near Goose Island. She was the &lsquo;Mary C,&rsquo; just
a freighter, but a good strong one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Abner Jones had her for his first
command. She was his last, too. He lived in
this cabin and sailed the Great Lakes for thirty-five
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when she struck one stormy night,
through no fault of his, he refused to leave
her. All through the storm he stuck there,
though she was half torn to pieces. When the
storm was over, his men went out to get him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still he wouldn&rsquo;t come. &lsquo;No, men. Much
obliged all the same,&rsquo; he told them. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
been a good crew. You&rsquo;ll find other berths.
But mine&rsquo;s here. I&rsquo;ll never leave this cabin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men went aside. I&rsquo;ve heard my father
tell it lots of times. They talked it over. They
loved their old skipper. They knew the next
storm would do for the ship, and him, too, if
he stayed. So they made a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, Cap,&rsquo; the first mate said, when
they had come back to him, &lsquo;you have your
way. And we&rsquo;ll have ours, too. Give us a day,
mebby two, and we&rsquo;ll put this cabin in a safe
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Meanin&rsquo; what?&rsquo; the captain asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That we&rsquo;ll set the cabin ashore, and you
in her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the captain saw they were too
strong for him, so he let them have their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took a lot more than two days. You
see what a neat job they did. Why, there&rsquo;s
even a hold to the place! They built it of ship&rsquo;s
timbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hold!&rdquo; Florence stared at her.</p>
<p>By way of answer, Tillie began rolling up
the canvas that covered the floor. When she
had done this, she pried up a plank, then another.
Next she sent the gleam of a flashlight
into the dark depths below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, a real hold!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a trunk!&rdquo; Tillie, too, was surprised.
&ldquo;How long do you suppose it&rsquo;s been
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long. See! The copper is not tarnished.
It&rsquo;s her trunk.&rdquo; She spoke of the lady cop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be. But such a queer trunk!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>It was indeed an unusual bit of baggage.
Made of some very hard tropical wood, it was
bound by broad bands of copper. Strangest
of all were its straps. They were four inches
wide and fully three quarters of an inch thick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What monster has a hide like that?&rdquo; Tillie
asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A walrus or an elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite naturally. One does not leave one&rsquo;s
things in a trunk in a cellar like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s wide open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all strange. A woman with a trunk
like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they stood there, staring
down into that dark chasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; exclaimed Tillie at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie was given to having ideas. Some of
them were quite wild, for Tillie was more
than half wild herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s steal her trunk!&rdquo; she cried, clapping
her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Florence in some disgust,
&ldquo;seems a dumb idea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so dumb as you think. Listen. Day
before yesterday I brought the lady cop a small
bag of balsam tips; you know, the green end
of twigs that smell so swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She took one sniff of them, then threw up
her hands and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like a trunk full, a
whole trunk full to take home to my friends,
for making pillows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll steal her trunk and hide it in the
woods. We&rsquo;ll fill it with balsam tips. Turkey
Trot and I will bring it back. She&rsquo;ll drop dead
when she sees it. She&rsquo;ll never know it&rsquo;s been
gone until she sees the balsam tips. Come on.
Give me a hand. She&rsquo;ll be back pretty soon.
We&rsquo;ll just hide it in the brush until we go
home. Then we&rsquo;ll carry it over to your point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, though not fully convinced of the
wisdom of such high-handed proceedings, was
quite carried away by Tillie&rsquo;s bubbling enthusiasm.
In less time than it takes to tell it, the
trunk was up from the dark hole and away to
the brush, the planks down again, the canvas
spread smoothly in place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>They were not a moment too soon. Shaking
the rain from her coat, the lady cop came
breezing in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo; she enthused. &ldquo;Even in the
night and the rain. I hate to leave it all. But
I fear I must. Very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last remark sent a chill running up
Florence&rsquo;s spine. But she said never a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />13-13 AND OTHER SIGNS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this cabin!&rdquo; The lady cop&rsquo;s
voice was filled with consternation as
she spoke. Florence and Tillie could only
stand and stare. The lady cop&rsquo;s room was a
wreck. She had gone out before dawn; had
been gone an hour, had picked up Florence
and Tillie on her way back, and now this!</p>
<p>Florence had never seen such a roomful of
confusion. Table upside down, chairs overturned,
clothing scattered everywhere, broken
glass from the transom overhead, the canvas
torn up, a gaping hole where the imitation
ship&rsquo;s hold was; such was the scene upon
which she gazed in the utmost astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Tillie in a tone that was
both serious and solemn, &ldquo;we girls didn&rsquo;t do
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, child!&rdquo; The lady cop
laughed in spite of herself. &ldquo;For all that, I
know who did it. And soon enough they shall
have their pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, too, what it was they wanted. And
they&mdash;&rdquo; The lady cop advanced to the center
of the room to cast one glance to the void
below, &ldquo;and they got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what was it they wanted?&rdquo; Florence
managed to stammer. She knew the answer,
but wanted it from the lady cop&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trunk! Why should they want that?
It was&mdash;&rdquo; She checked herself in time.</p>
<p>The lady cop gave her a sharp look, but proceeded
to answer her question as well as she
might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, I don&rsquo;t know why they wanted
that trunk,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;They have wanted it
for a long time. Now that they have it, I hope
they are satisfied. I can get a tin one down
at the store for a few dollars. And it, I hope,
will contain no secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets!&rdquo; Florence wished to tell her own
secret, that the mysterious trunk was safely
locked up in a hunting cabin back in the woods
where she and Tillie had carried it through the
rain and the dark. She did not quite dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That trunk,&rdquo; said the lady cop, up-ending
a chair and dropping into it, &ldquo;has been the
most spooky thing you ever saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin bought it for me at a police
auction sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A police auction sale!&rdquo; Tillie stared at her
hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once a year the police department sells all
the lost, stolen and unclaimed articles that
have come into its keeping. You&rsquo;d be surprised
at the variety of articles sold there; electric
drills, oriental rugs, watches, knives, burglars&rsquo;
tools, suitcases full of silks&mdash;everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This trunk was in the sale. It was filled
with a lot of worthless clothing. But my cousin
bought it for me. It was such an unusual
affair. Teakwood, heavy copper, walrus hide.
You wouldn&rsquo;t understand unless you saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Tillie exchanged significant
glances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This cousin of mine is a queer chap,&rdquo; the
lady cop went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always trying to break
up superstitions. Belongs to a Thirteen Club
formed in his academy days. Thirteen fellows
lived in a building numbered 1313. Table always
set for thirteen, whether they were all
there or not. Such things as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now every year on the thirteenth day of a
month, Friday if possible, they have a banquet.
Six of the thirteen are dead. Four met
violent deaths. Yet they keep it up. Thirteen
places set. Seven seats filled. Six vacant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes you shudder to think of it. But he
loves it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bought this trunk because a crook had
owned it. That&rsquo;s supposed to bring bad luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t got half way home with it before
someone dragged it off the truck. He
crowned the fellow with half a brick and retrieved
the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took it home. That night he woke up
to see it disappearing out of the window. When
he fired a shot through the window the trunk
paused in its journey and he took it back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, because I am a policewoman, he presented
it to me. And here&mdash;here it is not.
They got it at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the two girls exchanged glances.
They said never a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queerest part of it all is,&rdquo; the lady cop
concluded, &ldquo;the thing was chuck empty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come on!&rdquo; she exclaimed, springing up.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this place straightened out. Then
we&rsquo;ll fry some bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we tell her?&rdquo; Tillie asked in a low
tone as she and Florence walked down the
little dock half an hour later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Not just yet.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s
face took on a puzzled look. &ldquo;If that trunk has
such wandering ways, perhaps it&rsquo;s safer where
it is. Does anyone go to that hunting shack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time of year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no one besides us knows where the
trunk is, and we won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you this afternoon,&rdquo; Tillie added.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know it! Got to work this forenoon.
Can go after dinner. And boy! Will there be
fishing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she added with all the wisdom
of an old timer, &ldquo;after a three days&rsquo; storm is
the very best time to fish. When it is sunny
and still, the fish lay round and get lazy; too
lazy to eat. A storm stirs &rsquo;em up. Watch &rsquo;em
bite this P. M. So long!&rdquo; She went skipping
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />&ldquo;FISHIN&rsquo;&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Youth is the time of life when perils,
sorrows and battles are soon forgotten;
when joy persists, and the anticipation of some
fresh thrill is ever uppermost in the mind. As
they started on the proposed fishing trip rather
late that afternoon, Tillie, to all appearances,
had forgotten her battle with the children of
a rich city gambler. The splendid black bass
they had captured, the memory of the thrill
of the chase, was still with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said to Florence, &ldquo;I
think the other two bass are larger, much
larger? Perhaps one is a five pounder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have a grand time!&rdquo; she
enthused. &ldquo;There are two big muskies lurking
in those weeds. I saw them once. They may
strike to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think those hateful people will
come back?&rdquo; Florence wrinkled her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we gave &rsquo;em enough!&rdquo; Tillie clipped
her words short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said they&rsquo;d ruin you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby they can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s strong arms
worked fast at the oars.</p>
<p>They arrived at the fishing hole. Once more
the conditions were ideal. Dark, slaty clouds
lay spread across the sky. A slight breeze
roughened the surface of the water. Such
water as it was! Gray, shadowy water that
suggested fish of immense proportions and infinite
fighting power.</p>
<p>The whispering rushes, the gurgling water,
the bobbing dragon fly, were all there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if we had been gone but an hour,&rdquo;
Florence said, as she dropped the anchor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Tillie, &ldquo;this old bay changes
very little. I climbed up on Gull Rock to steal
a gull&rsquo;s eggs when I was three. And there it
stands still. And still the gulls lay their eggs
there. Only difference is, I have learned how
foolish it is to steal their eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>She baited her hook with a large minnow,
drew out her line until thirty feet of it hung
loosely coiled in her left hand; then with a deft
toss landed the minnow thirty feet from the
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;right over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was obliged to satisfy herself with
a shorter cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Tillie, and the sound
of her voice glided along like the air of some
old song, &ldquo;this has been my fishing hole ever
since I was old enough to paddle the first
little tub of a boat I ever owned? But it&rsquo;s
never lost its mystery, this hole hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been times when I thought I
knew all about it. I&rsquo;ve skated over it in winter
when the ice was like glass. I could see every
stone, every stick and log at the bottom. I
peered in between every little forest of pikeweed
and said, &lsquo;Nope, there&rsquo;s nothing there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been times in summer when the
surface of the water was smooth as a looking-glass.
Then I peeked around in every little
corner down there in the depths of it, and I
said, &lsquo;Ah, ha! At last I have you! I know all
about you. You&rsquo;re only a hole full of water
with a sandy bottom and a shelving bank.
You&rsquo;re full of weeds and other common things.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just about then the sun goes under a cloud.
A little breeze ripples the water. I can&rsquo;t see
a thing. I wait. The rain comes pattering
down. I put a shiny minnow or a dark old
crawdad on my hook and throw it far out over
the edge of the old fishing hole. Pretty soon
the line starts stealing away. My reel goes
round and round, silent as a whisper. Then
of a sudden I jerk. I begin reeling in. A beautiful
thing all green and gold leaps from the
water. But I have him still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I cry. &lsquo;A black bass. Where did he
come from? The old fishing hole, to be sure.&rsquo;
And right away that old pool with its mysterious
blue-green top of rippled, spattered water
is as full of mystery as it ever was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful to have such a fishing
hole!&rdquo; Florence enthused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all boys and girls have fishing holes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cities, of course not. It&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>For a time after that they were silent. It
was Florence who broke the Sabbath-like stillness
of the old fishing hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;are very much like
fishing holes. You have a friend. You are
with him a great deal. He tells you all he can
about himself. He turns the light of truth
upon himself and allows you to gaze into the
very depths of his soul. At last you say,
&lsquo;There is no mystery left in his being. I know
it all.&rsquo; Then of a sudden, in time of joyous
tempest, splendid success or dark storm of disappointment
and sorrow, in a moment demanding
heroic courage, he shows you in an instant
that there are possibilities in his being of
which you never dreamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cities are like that, too,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;Take the great city I call home. It&rsquo;s a very
plain city where millions toil for their daily
bread. I&rsquo;ve been all over it. I often say to
myself, &lsquo;There is no further mystery in this
city.&rsquo; I have no more than said it than I come
upon a Chinatown, a theatre, a court room,
some dark place at night where such persons
meet as I have never known. Then that old
city seems to look up and laugh as it exclaims,
&lsquo;No mystery!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must be wonderful to explore such a
city!&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s words were filled with longing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Florence, &ldquo;we can do it
together some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large perch took Florence&rsquo;s minnow. She
reeled him in and threw him in the live-net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably all I&rsquo;ll get,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;but
they are fine fried brown in butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie lost her minnow. A second and a
third disappeared into that dark expanse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s stealing my bait.&rdquo; She selected
a very large minnow and hooked it on with
meticulous care. Then out into the deep he
went to join his comrades.</p>
<p>The manner in which he did this was startling
in the extreme. Hardly had he hit the
water than Tillie&rsquo;s reel flew round and round,
quite beyond control. With a quick glance
toward the sky, she assured herself that some
thieving bird had not seized her bait, then she
pressed a thumb on her reel as she seized the
handle to end its wild flight. Fortunately her
line was long and strong. She had the fish
under control in another moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>But to play him, to land him&mdash;that was the
problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo; Florence asked in an awed
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie reeled him in for twenty yards, then
let him take the line slowly out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tire him out,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>This she repeated three times. Then as a
look of fixed determination settled on her face
she said quite calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landing net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was ready. Settling her feet firmly,
Tillie began to reel in. The manner in which
she reeled in that mysterious monster was a
thing to marvel at. And he came, foot by foot,
yard by yard, fathom by fathom, until a great
gaping mouth appeared close to the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A pike!&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s voice betrayed her disappointment.
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a darb. We must have
him. Get ready. When I give him line, get
the net ahead of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence obeyed with trembling fingers.
She was a second too late. Tillie did not give
the powerful fish line. He took it. Grazing the
rim of the landing net, he shot away, taking
fathoms of line with him.</p>
<p>The process of wearing him out was repeated.
Once again he was brought to the
side of the boat. This time Tillie gave him
very little line. Unfortunately it was not
enough. As his head shot toward the landing
net, the hook that protruded through his jaw
caught on the rim of the net. There was a
thundering of water, a whirlpool of white
spray, and he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb!&rdquo; exclaimed Tillie, throwing down
her rod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost him!&rdquo; Florence dropped the net. &ldquo;But
then,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;a pike&rsquo;s no good except to
look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Tillie. &ldquo;And we came
out here for a big black bass. We&rsquo;ll have him
too!&rdquo; She baited her hook anew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>An hour passed, and another. The sun hung
for a time above the cedars, then slowly sank
from sight. The water turned golden, then
red, then steel blue. Still they fished on.</p>
<p>The number of fine perch, nine, ten, twelve
inches long, which Florence dropped into the
live-net, grew and grew. Tillie flung hers overboard
in great contempt, as soon as they were
hooked, and grumbled because they took her
bait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Florence teasingly,
&ldquo;I believe I have five pounds of fish? You have
tried all afternoon for a five pounder, and got
nothing. In life one should humbly accept that
which comes, and hope for bigger things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo; Tillie studied her face with
tired eyes. &ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s so, or do you
win best if you insist on having only the big
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Florence replied, &ldquo;that one
does that which one&rsquo;s nature demands. I can&rsquo;t
throw a good perch away. You can&rsquo;t keep one.
It&rsquo;s a queer old world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; Tillie punctuated her remark with
a vigorous overhand throw that landed her
minnow far out into the darkening water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; she exclaimed a moment later.
&ldquo;See that line go out! It&rsquo;s a bass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing sweeter than the swift run
of a bass before he turns his minnow and
swallows it.</p>
<p>Zing! Tillie snapped the line. &ldquo;Hooked!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, planting her feet far apart.</p>
<p>The ripples had subsided. The water was
like polished steel at the surface. Yet one
could see far into those mysterious depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she exclaimed tensely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him!
The big one! And how meekly he comes in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What she said seemed true. She was reeling
in rapidly. At the same time a monster
of the lake, such a bass as Florence had never
dreamed of, came racing toward the boat.</p>
<p>Three yards, five, he shot forward. Florence
stared. The expression on Tillie&rsquo;s face
was a strange thing to see. Hope, joy, triumph
vied there with fear, distrust, despair.
It was her great chance. She had staked all in
the one cast. Was she to win or lose?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>During all this time the afterglow of the sun
had lighted the water. In an instant, without
warning, it faded and near darkness came.
Not so soon, however, but that the girls were
able to witness a strange sight. With a sudden
stop and whirl, the big bass changed
course and shot away. But Tillie&rsquo;s reel? It
did not spin. She still reeled in. A steady tug
held her line taut. Ten seconds later a beautiful
green-tinted bass, weighing perhaps a
pound, broke the water and landed with
scarcely a struggle in the boat.</p>
<p>What had happened? This little one and the
giant companion had fought for the deadly
minnow. He had won.</p>
<p>For fully half a minute, while the end of
twilight became night, Tillie stood staring at
her catch. He had flapped himself loose from
the line and lay there in the boat snapping
about.</p>
<p>Suddenly she seized him and threw him far
into the rushes. Then she dropped into a seat
to hide her face in her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Tillie was of the emotional type. Some people
are. What of it? Theirs is the privilege to
weep or to shout for joy. Tillie wept.</p>
<p>But what was this? Of a sudden their boat
gave a lurch that sent Florence sprawling
over the stern seat.</p>
<p>What had happened? Her eyes told her in
an instant. Her heart went to her throat. A
speed boat, with power shut off, had glided
upon them unobserved. The now invisible occupants
had seized their anchor line, then
started their powerful motor. They were now
headed for the outermost point of land and the
open sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got us!&rdquo; Tillie exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
got us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Florence screamed. &ldquo;In the name
of all that&rsquo;s good, who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie did not reply. She was making her
way forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />KIDNAPPED</h2>
<p>&ldquo;They are carrying us away!&rdquo; Florence
cried. Her tone was that of
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must cut the tiller,&rdquo; was Tillie&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll run us down, as they did
Jeanne and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter! We must cut the tiller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how? We have no knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie thought a moment. Then once more
she crept forward toward the bobbing prow.
Once there, she gripped the boat&rsquo;s gunwale,
reached far forward, then set her teeth in the
strong rope.</p>
<p>The tiller was an extra thick one, and quite
new. Nature had provided Tillie with a most
excellent set of teeth. She used them now
with a skill born of despair. Both she and
Florence were strong swimmers. Though
their boat were wrecked, they might still reach
land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only we do not get out of the channel,&rdquo;
she thought as she renewed her attack on the
stubborn strands of rope.</p>
<p>As they left Hoyt&rsquo;s Bay behind, the water
grew rougher. Shooting forward, the slight
rowboat plowed through waves instead of riding
over them. Tillie was drenched to the skin.
There were times when her very form was
lost in spray. Yet she stuck to her post.</p>
<p>Night had come. There was no moon. The
sky was black. The sea was black. The night
was cold. Florence shuddered. Then, feeling
the water creeping over her feet, she began to
bail.</p>
<p>Tillie&rsquo;s task was half done. How stout the
rope was. The pull on it was tremendous, yet
with half the strands cut, the boat rode on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how many more strands?&rdquo; she asked
herself as she spat out a mouthful of bristly
fibre.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Soon it will be too late,&rdquo; she told herself.
No longer could she distinguish land from
water, but years of experience told her that
they were fast leaving land behind, that they
would, in a very brief space of time, be in the
open waters of Lake Huron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; she breathed. She dare not
think.</p>
<p>The rope was at last three-fourths eaten
away. The strain on the remaining strands
was telling. They were beginning to stretch
when suddenly a final cowardly and brutal
act capped the atrocities of the heartless invisible
ones. Had they been watching? Did
they know the girl&rsquo;s purpose? Had they
judged their position? Who knows? Enough
that of a sudden their boat gave a swerve to
the right. It executed a curve that no light
rowboat could endure. Next instant the girls
found themselves pitched head foremost into
the icy waters, while their empty boat sped
on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Florence struck out with hands and feet.
She gave herself half a minute to regain composure.
Then she looked for Tillie. Tillie was
swimming with one hand while she shook a
belligerent fist at the fast disappearing speed
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she exclaimed when she had completed
this ceremony to her satisfaction. &ldquo;We
are free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free as a gull. Where&rsquo;s land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long can you swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long time. How long can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long time. But in this water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Boo! It&rsquo;s cold. Let&rsquo;s swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, as if in answer to an unuttered
prayer, a strange thing happened. A
golden light shone across the water. A golden
disk appeared on the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon! Thank&mdash;thank God!&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s
tone was reverent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moon, yes,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;It usually
rises.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you see? It&rsquo;s not rising behind
water, but trees. That&rsquo;s Goose Island over
there. It&rsquo;s three miles from the mainland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Goose Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where we go fishing through the ice
in winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody live there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any cabins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence stopped herself. She was about to
say that outside a cabin, with no fire, drenched
to the skin, they would be chilled to death,
when a voice seemed to whisper, &ldquo;One thing at
a time. Only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll swim for it,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;How
far do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two miles, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two miles! Her heart sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the wind and waves are with us. We&rsquo;ll
make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winds and the waves obey Thy will,&rdquo;
rang through Florence&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;we will make it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>For a long time there was no sound save
the dip-dip of their strong arms and the occasional
swirl of a whitecap as it broke near
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />STRANGE DELIVERANCE</h2>
<p>An hour passed and still two dark spots,
like markers for a gill net, rose above
the waves. The moon, rising higher and higher,
brought out more distinctly the ragged tree
line of Goose Island.</p>
<p>At times the weary girls turned on their
backs to float like so much lifeless driftwood.
When their weary muscles had gained renewed
strength, they began their task again.</p>
<p>There were times when Florence, stout-hearted
though she was, was tempted to give
up hope. At such times she envisioned the
rocky beach, the cabinless forest of scrub trees
that must grace the surface of the island. She
felt, too, the chill of the wind that must await
them there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; she asked herself many
times. And always the answer came, &ldquo;One
step at a time is enough for me.&rdquo; She must
trust the future.</p>
<p>As for Tillie, she never faltered. Such is
the soul of one bred to the rigor, the suffering
and perils of the north country. It accepts
the condition that each moment offers and
awaits the rest. Who will say that this, as a
rule of life, is not best?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerio, old thing!&rdquo; Tillie exclaimed at
last. &ldquo;Another quarter of an hour, and we will
be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was courage in her voice, but a look
of utter weariness in her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she last?&rdquo; Florence drew one more
portion from her reserve strength, prepared, if
need be, to see her gallant friend through.</p>
<p>Her aid was not needed. The sturdy muscles
and vigorous heart of this backwoods girl
carried her through. Certainly no city cousin
of hers who starves her body and poisons her
blood to obtain a slim and graceful figure could
have done as much. Who wants to be a wisp
that contains a soul? Who would not rather
be a Greek goddess?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>They landed at last upon a broad and pebbly
beach.</p>
<p>As they crept up away from the waves, the
sharp pebbles brought no pain to hands and
knees. They were benumbed by cold, too exhausted
to feel pain.</p>
<p>Yet, after Tillie had laid there for a moment,
she drew herself to a sitting position to say
an astonishing thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get that
old black bass yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the cold and exhaustion, Florence
laughed. The laugh did them both good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are going to do that,&rdquo; she said, rising
stiffly, &ldquo;we will have to keep moving. If
we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll be no better than the wreck of
the Hesperus. Let&rsquo;s go somewhere. It&rsquo;s a little
late, but some place on the island may still
be open. A ham and egg place. Haven&rsquo;t any
money, but they&rsquo;ll trust us. We look <i>so</i> honest,
and our clothes are <i>so</i> spick and span.&rdquo;
She looked at Tillie, in her blouse that clung
like a rag and knickers that turned her slim
legs into pipe stems, and laughed again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Tillie, struggling to keep
up the illusion. &ldquo;I know a place to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made her way up the gravel beach to
a spot where the surface was soft, sandy and
half overgrown with grass. Then they started
to skirt the shore.</p>
<p>They had not gone a hundred yards before
Florence began to feel that Tillie was leading
a lost hope. The wind was rising. The cold
seemed more bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never will stand it,&rdquo; she told herself with
grim conviction. &ldquo;Never in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still she trudged on. Her limbs were growing
stiff, her eyes blurred. As they rounded
a clump of scrub birch trees, she thought her
eyes deceived her. There appeared to be something
over there that was not a tree; a small
square thing like an overgrown chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She pulled Tillie by the arm.
&ldquo;Look, Tillie! Is there something over
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie looked, then cried out for very joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fish shanty! Daddy Red Johnson&rsquo;s
fish shanty! He left it here winter before last.
Then he died. Nobody touched it. Oh, thank
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped to her knees, but was up in an
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like a shanty,&rdquo; said Florence
as they approached it. &ldquo;Looks like a tall
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all it is. Four sides and a
roof. Three feet square. Just a protection from
wind and snow while you fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh, good old Daddy Johnson, if you
see us now,&rdquo; she murmured, talking to the sky,
&ldquo;you know we need your fish shanty a heap
worse than you ever did!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the door,&rdquo; she said a moment later.
&ldquo;Walk right in and make yourself at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside this curious box-like affair, which is
moved so easily over the ice during the winter
fishing, there was only standing room for two.</p>
<p>But how warm it seemed! &ldquo;As if there were
a fire.&rdquo; Florence hugged Tillie for very joy.
Then she thanked the Creator of all for this
miraculous deliverance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be hard,&rdquo; she told herself, as
she thought of standing there all night, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll make it. And to-morrow we will improve
our condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do boats pass this island?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only very far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could they see a signal flag of distress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Besides, they wouldn&rsquo;t be looking
for it. No one is ever stranded here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of fire,&rdquo; mused Tillie, returning
to the old subject, &ldquo;Daddy Red Johnson used
to keep a few sticks in the upper corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; she cried as her hand
searched the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody liked Daddy Red Johnson.&rdquo;
There were tears in her voice. &ldquo;He was a good
man. Nobody would touch his things, not
even after he was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always kept a box of matches right
down here.&rdquo; Her hand groped for a moment.
Then such a shout of joy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are! Saved, Florence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With trembling fingers she drew out a safety
match and struck it on the box. It flared
out cheerily, dispelling the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll carry this
shanty to the beach. We&rsquo;ll build a roaring fire
before it and be all warm and dry before you
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they tumbled out of the shanty, then
tipped it over, something fell to the ground
with a thud. It was a short handled axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot the axe,&rdquo; said Tillie, tucking it under
her arm. &ldquo;He used that for cutting his
hole through the ice, Daddy Red Johnson did.
Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if his fish line was here,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />OUTBOUND IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne was disturbed. Nine
o&rsquo;clock had come and passed. Reluctantly
she made tea and drank it alone. Florence
was not back. It was strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went fishing, she and Sun-Tan Tillie,&rdquo;
she said to Tico, the bear. &ldquo;One does not
fish at night, unless it is for bull-heads. And
who wishes for bull-heads? Bah! They are like
snakes. You cut off their heads, and still they
bite your finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten o&rsquo;clock found her pacing the floor. Having
at last arrived at a decision, she dressed
hurriedly in knickers and a heavy jacket, drew
a pair of men&rsquo;s rubber boots on over her shoes,
called to Tico, and went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>There was, she knew, a trail through the
forest to the village. She had never followed
it. She dared try it now. So, armed only with
a flashlight, with the bear at her heels, she set
out.</p>
<p>She was disturbed more than she cared to
admit, even to herself. She feared, not for
herself, but for Florence. All these strange,
half told tales that had reached her ears, tales
of gamblers and lady detectives, of strange
water gypsies and half savage bears, had
worked upon her imagination. One who knows
no fear for his own safety is often the first to
fear for others. Such was the nature of the
little French girl. So she started out over an
unknown trail at night in search of aid.</p>
<p>The trail was long and winding. More than
once she lost herself. It was boggy in places.
There was need for boots. At times she was
obliged to take one step at a time, then lift
the other foot out of the mud by the boot
straps.</p>
<p>When at last she reached the silent, sleeping
village, she was near exhaustion. The
silence of the village frightened her more than
the lonely forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if everyone in the world were dead,&rdquo;
she told herself through teeth that chattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must find that boy, Turkey Trot,&rdquo; she
said to Tico. &ldquo;He may know something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint light at the rear of Tillie&rsquo;s house
was reassuring. Someone was there.</p>
<p>She knocked loudly at the door. A boy appeared
with a lamp held high over his head.</p>
<p>The lamp descended with a crash. Fortunately
it went out. The boy, who was Turkey
Trot, had seen the bear, and had not seen
Jeanne standing in the shadows. He vanished.</p>
<p>Driven to desperation, Jeanne sprang after
him, seized him by the collar, and flashed her
light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you run?&rdquo; she demanded fiercely.
&ldquo;Where is my friend? Where is Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the bear!&rdquo; Turkey Trot still trembled.
&ldquo;Where is Tillie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks went to the Soo this morning. Be
back to-morrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I got a motor, an outboard motor,&rdquo; he
added cheerfully. &ldquo;Man gave it to me this
morning. It&rsquo;s a hummer. Plenty of boats.
We&rsquo;ll go find them. Broke an oar, like as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Do you think so? Could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tow-headed boy had suddenly become
a savior in Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with the bear?&rdquo; the boy
asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could take him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he bite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tico? Never! He is tame. Oh, very!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later an outboard motor began
its put-put-put. A sixteen foot boat with
Jeanne in the prow, Turkey Trot in the stern,
and the ponderous bear in the middle, was
headed out toward Gull Rock Point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know where they fish, I do,&rdquo; Turkey Trot
shouted above the noise of the motor. &ldquo;Find
&rsquo;em out there somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered to herself.
There was doubt in her mind and misgiving
in her heart. Florence had not stayed out like
that before, without announcing her purpose.
And there were strange doings about, very
strange doings indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>The water was black with the peculiar blackness
that is night. The path of pale light cast
across it by the moon only served to intensify
that blackness. From time to time Jeanne sent
a narrow pencil of light from her electric
torch. In a wavering circle this light searched
the sea. Its efforts were in vain. No craft was
on the water at all at that late hour. Florence
and Tillie, as you know, were far away.</p>
<p>They reached Gull Rock Point. Still they
discovered nothing. They began circling the
deep bays between points of land. One wide
circle passed within their view, a second and
a third.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, Turkey Trot, whose
eyes were familiar with every detail of those
shores, uttered a low exclamation. Turning
sharply, he headed straight for a log-strewn,
sandy beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne had seen only logs. Turkey
Trot had seen that which set his blood racing.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, on their bleak and barren
island, Tillie and Florence were not idle. The
fish shanty which they had found was composed
of a light frame of wood and an outer
covering of fibre board. Tillie seized the edge
of the roof, Florence the bottom. Thus, in the
half darkness, stumbling over stumps and
stones, but cheered by the thought that here
at last was shelter and a degree of warmth,
they made their way to the beach.</p>
<p>There, with the aid of the axe, they split
a dry cedar stick into small splints. They next
lay down side by side in order to break the
force of the wind, and Tillie struck a match.
It flickered and flashed, then blazed up. Another
moment, and the dry cedar was crackling
like corn in a popper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire!&rdquo; Florence breathed. &ldquo;A fire! Oh,
Tillie, a fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment she was as emotional as
her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Soon they had a roaring fire of driftwood.
The lake level had risen three feet that spring.
Great quantities of dead timber, to say nothing
of logs and planks from docks, had been
carried away. There was no scarcity of fuel.</p>
<p>The dance they did that night beneath the
moon while their clothes were drying was a
thing of wild witchery. But what of that?
There was none to witness save the stars. The
island was all their own.</p>
<p>When at last their clothes were dry, with
a fire of hot coals before them, they packed
themselves like two very large sardines into
the fish shanty, which lay side down on the
beach with its door open to the fire. In ten
minutes they were both sound asleep.</p>

<br />A SCREAM IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The object that had caught Turkey Trot&rsquo;s
eye as he skirted the log-strewn beach was
a rowboat that, bumping on the beach now
and then as if in a futile attempt to drive itself
ashore, lifted its prow in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tillie&rsquo;s!&rdquo; he breathed as they came
close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The anchor&rsquo;s gone. Painter cut.&rdquo; The
boy&rsquo;s trained eye took in every detail. The
oars, too, were gone. But within the boat, on
a stout cord, mute testimony to Florence&rsquo;s
afternoon of perch fishing, lay a dozen or more
dead perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They fished,&rdquo; said Turkey Trot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is fishing good in this bay?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We never come here. Tillie never does.
Sand and small rocks. No weeds in the bay.
They didn&rsquo;t fish here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time Turkey Trot did not answer.
Then suddenly his face brightened. &ldquo;Lots of
raspberries back there.&rdquo; He nodded toward
the fringe of forest that skirted the shore.
&ldquo;Clearing, back a little way. Lots of trails.
Might have gone back there and got lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the anchor? The cut painter? The
dead fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the boy shrugged. &ldquo;All I know
is, we might find something back there. We
can&rsquo;t find anything more here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this argument Jeanne found no answer.
They silently grounded their boat on the sand.
Turkey Trot drew it up on the beach. He did
the same for Tillie&rsquo;s light craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he murmured, as he gazed at
the painter. &ldquo;Brand new rope. Looks like it
had been chawed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he put out his hand for the flashlight,
then led the way into the timber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>What can be more spooky than following
a woodland trail far from the homes of men
at the dead of night? Nor was this particular
trail devoid of sad ruins telling of other days.
They had not followed the narrow, winding,
tree-shadowed trail a hundred rods when they
came to the ruins of what had once been a
prosperous logging camp.</p>
<p>Years had passed since the last sound of axe,
the last buzz of saw, the last shout of teamster
had died away. The roof of the cook shack
had fallen in. A score of bushes had lifted
their heads through its rotting floor.</p>
<p>The bunk house, proudly displaying its roof,
still stood. Its door, which hung awry, was
wide open. Into this door, from off the shadowy
trail, a dark spot dashed.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne started, then drew back. Was
it a wolf, a wandering dog, or some less formidable
creature? Without glancing back, she at
last plodded doggedly on. Since Turkey Trot
carried the torch, she was obliged to follow or
be left in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Once more they were lost in the shadows
of cedars and birches as the trail wound up
a low hill. And then they came upon the most
mournful sight of all, an abandoned home.</p>
<p>Standing as it did at the center of a grass-grown
clearing, with door ajar and broken
windows agape, the thing stared at them as
a blind man sometimes appears to stare with
sightless eyes. To make matters worse, three
tall pines with mournful drooping branches
stood in a graveyard-like cluster near the door,
while beneath them, shining white, some object
seemed a marble slab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; Turkey Trot&rsquo;s stolid young soul at
last was stirred. &ldquo;We&mdash;we won&rsquo;t pass that
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned down a trail that forked to the
right.</p>
<p>Hardly had he done this than Petite Jeanne
gripped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Her voice was tense.</p>
<p>Turkey Trot did listen, and to his ears came
the sound of music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s a banjo or somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;And&mdash;and singin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>He turned a startled gaze toward the deserted
cabin. The sound appeared to come
from there. His feet moved restlessly. He appeared
about to flee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t them,&rdquo; he said in a near whisper.
He spoke of Florence and Tillie. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t
have no banjo. And besides, they wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo; Petite Jeanne had him by
the arm. &ldquo;All the same, we must see. They
may know something. Many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved a few steps down the trail they
had chosen. At once they were able to see
more clearly. Behind the cabin, and within
its shadows, was a half burned-out camp fire.
And about the fire people sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can these be?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>Turkey Trot did not reply. Instead, he took
her by the hand and led her farther down the
trail.</p>
<p>In time this trail, after circling the narrow
hill, came up again, thus bringing them nearer
the camp fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>At last the boy dropped on hands and knees
and began to crawl. Following his example,
Jeanne lost herself in the thick bed of tall ferns.</p>
<p>They had crept silently forward to a point
where it seemed that a parting of the ferns
would show them the camp of the strangers,
when suddenly a blood curdling scream rent
the air.</p>
<p>Instantly Turkey Trot flattened himself to
the earth. As Jeanne did the same, she found
her heart beating like waves on a rocky shore.</p>
<p>She thought of Tillie and Florence. The
tiller of their boat had been cut. She recalled
this. Their boat was adrift. Had they been
kidnapped and carried here?</p>
<p>Instantly she was on her feet and darting
forward. Knowing nothing of her thoughts,
anxious only for her safety, the boy seized her
foot. She fell heavily, then lay there motionless,
as if dead.</p>
<p>The boy was in a panic. But not for long.
She was only stunned. Presently she sat up
dizzily.</p>
<p>They listened. Then they rose to their feet.
A strange sound had come to them. They
guessed its origin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>When they reached the camp fire no person
was there. Old Tico stood grunting with
satisfaction over a box of berries spilled in
someone&rsquo;s hurried departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tico!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne. &ldquo;We forgot him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. In their excitement they had
forgotten the bear. Having smelled refreshments,
he had taken a direct course to the
strangers&rsquo; camp. Beyond doubt he had poked
his nose over the shoulder of some fair young
lady. A scream, panic, and hasty retreat had
followed.</p>
<p>But who were these people that indulged in
an after midnight feast in so lonely a spot? To
this question the boy and girl immediately
sought an answer.</p>
<p>They were not long in forming a partial
answer. It was Jeanne who cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See this handkerchief. Only a gypsy, a
French gypsy, wears one like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this cigarette case!&rdquo; she added a moment
later. &ldquo;See! It is from France, too!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies, French gypsies!&rdquo; A note of sorrow
crept into her voice. &ldquo;They have been
here. Now they are gone. I wanted to see
them, only to hear them speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How little she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The boy held up a hand.</p>
<p>From the nearby shore came the thunder
of a speed boat leaving the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do gypsies have speed boats?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s wise answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are our friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t find them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Turkey Trot was now fully convinced
that his sister and Florence had been taken
captive by these strange dark people. He
knew little of gypsies. He had heard that they
carried people away. He did not wish to disturb
Petite Jeanne, so he said not a word.
Such was the big heart of the village boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well go home,&rdquo; was his conclusion.</p>
<p>Jeanne did not question this. They passed
around the staring cabin and down the trail
toward the ruins of the lumber camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Turkey Trot walked rapidly. Jeanne, who
was afraid of tripping in the dark, was a little
way behind him, when she came abreast of
the black bunk house that gloomed in the
dark. She stole one glance at it. Then her
heart stood still. From the depths of that
darkness two eyes gleamed at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green eyes!&rdquo; She barely missed crying
aloud.</p>
<p>With three bounds she was at Turkey Trot&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>Even then she did not speak. The boy had
not seen the things. Why disturb him? Perhaps
she had seen nothing. Those eyes may
have been a creation of her overwrought imagination.
So she reasoned, and was silent.</p>
<p>Turkey Trot was firm in his belief that the
missing girls had been carried away. He fastened
a rope to the remains of Tillie&rsquo;s painter,
and took the boat in tow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be back for it,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Big seas come in here. Smash it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he started his motor and they went
pop-popping toward home in the deep darkness
that lay just before dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />&ldquo;A BOAT! A BOAT!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The sun was high when Florence and
Tillie woke on the island where for a time
they were Crusoes. Their first thought was of
food. To Tillie, Goose Island was no unknown
land. She had been here often in winter. The
time had been when wild geese laid their eggs
here. They came no more. There would be
no eggs for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish for breakfast,&rdquo; Tillie declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
our only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No line,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Here&rsquo;s one.&rdquo; Tillie produced one
from the pocket of her knickers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a can of worms in your pocket, too?&rdquo;
Florence asked with a laugh. To her the affair
was becoming a lark. The sun was bright and
cheering, the sea a glorious blue. There was
not a cloud in the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone will find us,&rdquo; she declared hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a long way off the ship channel,&rdquo;
said Tillie. &ldquo;We may be here for days. They&rsquo;ll
search the shores for our boats and our bodies.&rdquo;
She shuddered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll beat the forest for
miles before they think of looking on Goose
Island. And you may be sure enough that
those villains, whoever they were, will never
whisper a word of it. They think we are at
the bottom of the lake. That&rsquo;s what they hope,
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence.&rdquo; Her tone became quite solemn.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not whether you are rich or poor that
counts. It&rsquo;s whether you are honest and loyal
and kind. Take Daddy Red Johnson. He was
poor. But he was square and kind. Once when
he was fishing for trout he caught a ninety
pound sturgeon. Mighty near pulled him
through the hole. He got over ten dollars for
it. He called that Providence. Said God sent
the sturgeon so he could help out a poor Indian
who was sick and had only dried fish to
eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was poor. But he was good and kind.
Then there&rsquo;s the Eries. They&rsquo;ve got millions;
yacht worth a hundred thousand, big cottage
up here, sailboats, speed boat, everything.
But they&rsquo;re just as square as any poor folks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we get back!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;ll suffer for this! Cedar Point has
had enough of that sort of thing. Crooks rob
city folks in the winter. Then they come up
here to try and have a good time like real
people. Do you think they ever can? Not
much! Man with a black heart never has a
good time anywhere. Cedar Point has had
enough badness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s the question of breakfast!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Plenty of minnows if we can
catch &rsquo;em. Pull off your shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For half an hour they labored on the sandy
beach, in shallow water, constructing a minnow
trap of stones and sticks. They made a
narrow pond that could be closed quickly.
After corralling a school of sand minnows,
they closed them in. One of them was soon
flopping on Tillie&rsquo;s hook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to swim for my breakfast,&rdquo; she explained,
rapidly disrobing. &ldquo;Some big old
rock bass out there beneath that rock, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She plunged into the water, swam thirty
yards, then mounted the rock.</p>
<p>Standing there in the morning sunshine, she
seemed a statue of bronze.</p>
<p>The statue became a thing of great animation
shortly after her minnow hit the water.
She had hooked a fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a whopper!&rdquo; she shouted back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get more, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did. Half an hour later four plump
rock bass, spiked to a broad plank, were roasting
to a delicious brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing better than planked fish,&rdquo; said
Tillie, as she cleaned up the last morsel and
sucked her fingers. &ldquo;Next problem is one of
transportation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tickets for two,&rdquo; replied Florence, &ldquo;and no
return tickets, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tillie philosophically.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t half bad; not near so bad as
what was intended for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone was a sober one, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice took on a more
cheerful tone, &ldquo;this appears to be our island.
We&rsquo;d better explore it. There may be some
&lsquo;Man Friday&rsquo; just around the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started out along the pebbly beach.
Here and there they came upon bits of wreckage
from cottagers&rsquo; docks that had been carried
away by the high water. Two posts joined
by cross pieces, long planks very full of spikes,
short bits of broken boards&mdash;such was the
driftwood that obstructed their path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough planks and nails to build a house,&rdquo;
was Tillie&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Florence became enthusiastic
at once. &ldquo;At least we could build a three-sided
shelter with one side open to the fire. That&rsquo;s
good sound lumber.&rdquo; She struck one plank a
thwack with the small axe she carried in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might,&rdquo; admitted Tillie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better
go farther. Find the best place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>They trudged on. Then, quite unexpectedly,
as they turned a corner, they saw something
looming in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat! A boat!&rdquo; Florence fairly shrieked
this as she went racing away.</p>
<p>She was not wholly wrong. It was a boat.
But one of those heavy, flat bottomed affairs,
used only by commercial fishermen, it lay bottom
up, displaying three stoved-in planks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn her over.&rdquo; Tillie&rsquo;s tone was
wholly practical. She had been brought up in
a boat.</p>
<p>They put their shoulders to the craft, and
over it went.</p>
<p>Tillie tapped it here and hacked at it there
with the axe. &ldquo;Not so bad,&rdquo; was her final
judgment. &ldquo;Sides are sound. Stern, too. Have
to give her three new planks in her bottom.
We can calk up the seams with moss and rosin.
Make some oars out of cedar poles, and there
you are. It&rsquo;ll be a stiff pull. All of two miles
to shore. But we&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will all that take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe two days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>At once Florence became downcast. She
was beginning to think of Petite Jeanne. She
had come to this place for rest. &ldquo;Little rest
she&rsquo;ll get while I am missing!&rdquo; she thought
gloomily. &ldquo;We ought to get away from here
at once. But how can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she spoke in as cheerful a tone
as she could command. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to work at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did get to work, and made famous
progress, too. Lunch forgotten, supper forgotten,
they toiled on until, just as the sun was
dropping low, Tillie declared the clumsy craft
would float.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No oars,&rdquo; objected Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can pole her close to shore,&rdquo; replied Tillie.
&ldquo;Try to take her down to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proved a Herculean task. The boat
was clumsy and hard to steer. Three times she
filled and all but sank. Bailing with a small
wooden box they found was slow work. They
reached camp at last, tired, soaked to the skin,
and ravenously hungry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to have caught some fish,&rdquo; Tillie
said remorsefully. &ldquo;Too late now. Only bullheads
bite in the dark. They stay in the bullrushes.
None here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made a fire, dried their clothes, then
heated some water in a hollow stone. To this
water they added bitter willow leaves. As they
sipped this they pretended they were drinking
tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Tillie with a sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
catch a lot of fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I would like to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe,&rdquo; replied Tillie thoughtfully.
&ldquo;All depends on that old boat. If she only
soaks up so she don&rsquo;t leak like a gill net, we
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing left for it but to attempt
to round out the night with sleep. They were
tired enough for that, beyond question.</p>
<p>After building a hot fire, they curled up in
their herring box shelter and prepared to sleep.</p>
<p>Florence had all but drifted off to the land
of dreams, when she fancied she heard the
throb of a motor. The impression was half
real, half dream. Reality struggled for a time
with dream life. Dream life won, and she slept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br />THE &ldquo;SPANK ME AGAIN&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Florence awoke with a start. She sat
up abruptly, rubbing her eyes in a futile
attempt to remember where she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;This is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dull red glow met her eyes. Like a flash
she knew. She and Tillie had started their
second night on Goose Island. The red glow
was their camp fire, burned low. She had been
asleep for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that sound!&rdquo; She was now fully awake.
A loud throbbing beat in upon her eardrums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boat! Some sort of motor boat!&rdquo; she
fairly screamed. &ldquo;Tillie! Tillie! Wake up!
There&rsquo;s a boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tillie did wake up. She sprang to her feet
to stare into the darkness at a spot where a
dot of red light was cutting its way through
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s passing!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that
boy in the &lsquo;Spank Me Again.&rsquo; He has not seen
our fire. We must scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scream they did, fairly splitting their lungs.
And with the most astonishing results.</p>
<p>The crazy little craft gave vent to a series
of sharp sput-sput-sputs. Then suddenly it
went dead; the light disappeared. Night, dark
and silent as the grave, hung over all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we frightened him,&rdquo; Tillie gasped.
&ldquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;went over. He may be hurt, may
drown. We must save him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim.&rdquo; Tillie was kicking off her shoes.</p>
<p>Florence followed her example. Together
they entered the chilling water to begin one
more long swim, to the spot where the strange
little motor boat had last been seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt,&rdquo; Tillie panted between strokes,
&ldquo;or he&rsquo;d yell for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence thought this probable, and her
heart chilled. In their eagerness for deliverance,
had they caused another to lose his life?
She redoubled her efforts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>A dark bulk, lying close to the water, appeared
before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat,&rdquo; thought Florence, &ldquo;it did not
sink. There is hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right. As they reached the overturned
boat, they found the Erie boy, in a
semi-conscious condition and with a bad cut
on his temple, clinging feebly to the stern.</p>
<p>To assist him to a position across the boat&rsquo;s
narrow hull, then to push and pull the small
craft ashore, was the work of an hour.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the beach, the boy
had so far regained his strength that he was
able, with their assistance, to walk to their
camp.</p>
<p>A great fire was soon busy dispelling the
cold, while clouds of steam rose from their
drenched clothing.</p>
<p>Florence bandaged the boy&rsquo;s head; then,
with all the skill of a trained nurse, she brought
him fully back to life by chafing his hands and
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;so that&rsquo;s who it was?&rdquo; he found words
to gasp at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was&mdash;well, mebby I didn&rsquo;t
think at all. I just lost control and she went
over. Good thing you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; There was conviction in Tillie&rsquo;s
tone. &ldquo;I always knew that thing would kill
you. And it&rsquo;s pretty near done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty close,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you here?&rdquo; he asked in some
amazement, as he took in their crude accommodations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we can&rsquo;t get away. We&rsquo;re marooned,&rdquo;
Florence explained.</p>
<p>She proceeded to relate in a dramatic manner
their strange adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beasts!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy. &ldquo;How
could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that gets asked pretty often these
days,&rdquo; said Florence soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question is,&rdquo; mused the boy, &ldquo;how are we
to get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boat&mdash;&rdquo; began Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soaked. Engine dead. Besides, she carries
only one person. Positively. Couldn&rsquo;t even
hold one of you on my lap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve fixed up a sort of boat, wreck of an
old dory,&rdquo; suggested Tillie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she float?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Give you a tow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; The boy stood up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
better get my motor and bring it to the fire.
Dry it out by morning. Got a three gallon
can of gas. Be away with the dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor was soon doing its share of
steaming by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got some rations?&rdquo; the boy asked. &ldquo;Of
course you haven&rsquo;t. But I have. Regular feast,
all in cans. Always carried &rsquo;em for just such a
time as this. Boiled chicken in one can, chili
con carne in another, and a sealed tin of pilot
biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought this unbelievable feast to the
place before the fire. When the chicken and
the chili had been warmed, they enjoyed a repast
such as even the millionaire&rsquo;s son had
seldom eaten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, as the last morsel disappeared,
&ldquo;as it says in &lsquo;The Call of the Wild,&rsquo;
&lsquo;He folded his hands across his feet before
the fire, allowed his head to drop forward on
his breast and fell fast asleep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; exclaimed Tillie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not try
to sleep. Let&rsquo;s tell ghost stories till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; the boy seconded with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;And the one who tells the best one
wins this.&rdquo; He laid a shining gold piece before
them on a rock.</p>
<p>The contest was carried forward with spirit
and animation. But Sun-Tan Tillie, with her
weird stories of that north country was easily
winner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we shall see how it performs,&rdquo; said
the boy, rising stiffly as day began to dawn.</p>
<p>He lifted his motor from its place before the
fire, and carried it to his boat. Five minutes
had not elapsed before it began to sput-sput
merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you home for breakfast,&rdquo; he predicted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>He made good his word. Just as Jeanne and
Turkey Trot, after one more night of fruitless
search, sat down to their oatmeal, bacon, and
coffee, two well soaked girls broke in upon
them. By dint of diligent bailing they had
forced their crazy dory, towed by the equally
crazy &ldquo;Spank Me Again,&rdquo; to carry them home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br />GLOWING WATERS</h2>
<p>There were dark looks on many faces
as the story of the kidnapping of the two
girls and the atrocious attempt at their lives
spread about the village. The native population
of this Northland is intensely loyal to its
own people. The summer sojourners, too, had
come to have a great love for the happy, carefree
Tillie, who caught their minnows and
helped to launch their boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something will come of this,&rdquo; was the word
on many a tongue.</p>
<p>As for Florence, after receiving Jeanne&rsquo;s
open-hearted and joyous welcome home, her
first thought was of the lady cop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must tell her at once,&rdquo; she said to
Tillie. &ldquo;Our experience may fit into the task
she has before her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Tillie, &ldquo;we must.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>They rowed at once to the lonely cabin
among the cedars.</p>
<p>But what was this? As they made their
way up from the dock, they spied a white paper
fluttering at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s intuition.</p>
<p>She was right. On the paper, written in the
round hand of the lady cop, were these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>They are gone. I must follow. Good-bye, girls.
And thank you. I hope to meet you in another
world.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr"><i>The Lady Cop.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a moment they stared in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Florence repeated at last. &ldquo;They
have gone! She means the gamblers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another world,&rdquo; Jeanne read in a daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have her trunk!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her trunk?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in
astonishment. She had not been told of this
episode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; Florence eased herself unsteadily
to a low railing. Then she told the story
of the trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;we have that
mysterious trunk, which was wanted by the
gamblers, though why, not even the lady cop
could guess, on our hands. They want it. She
wants it. We have it. And we do not know
her real name. She implied the Miss Weightman
was an assumed name. What a pickle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sour pickle indeed!&rdquo; agreed Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow we leave for Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow! It does not seem possible.&rdquo;
The little French girl&rsquo;s heart went into a flutter.
This meant that ten days from this time
she would be at the center of a great stage
strewn with broken instruments of war, and
lighted only by an artificial moon, doing the
gypsy tarantella while a vast audience looked
on and&mdash;</p>
<p>Applauded? Who could say? So much must
come of this crowded quarter of an hour. Her
heart stood still; then it went racing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;only time can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Florence agreed, thinking
of quite another matter. &ldquo;We may be able
to find her in Chicago and return her trunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; She closed her eyes for a
moment. &ldquo;Now I must go to our cabin and
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of that day was uneventful.
But night set all the village agog.</p>
<p>After a good sleep, Florence had assisted
Jeanne with the packing in preparation for the
morrow&rsquo;s departure. They had said their sad
farewell to night and the stars, a farewell that
night and stars were not to accept as final.
They had crept beneath their blankets and had
fallen fast asleep.</p>
<p>Florence awoke some time later with the
glow of an unusual light in her eyes.</p>
<p>Springing out of bed, she rushed to the window.
The next instant she was shaking Jeanne
as she exclaimed excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne! Jeanne! Wake up! There is a fire!
A big fire somewhere on the bay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After struggling into their outer garments,
they rushed to the water&rsquo;s edge and launched
their boat.</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they discovered
the location of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on Gamblers&rsquo; Island.&rdquo; Her voice was
tense with emotion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the gamblers&rsquo; cottage.
It will burn to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last seemed certain. Already the flames
were mounting high. Even in the village there
was scant fire protection. On the smaller islands
there was none.</p>
<p>Florence seemed to hear the beating of her
own heart. Here was swift revenge for a cowardly
crime.</p>
<p>But was it revenge? The lady cop had said
the gamblers were gone. Perhaps they were
not all gone. One might have remained behind
to light the blaze, to cover some evil deed.
Who could tell?</p>
<p>Then again, the fire might have been accidental,
a mouse chewing a match.</p>
<p>All this time Florence was rowing sturdily.
They were approaching the scene of the fire.
Other boats were coming. Rowboats, motor
boats, speed boats, like particles of steel attracted
by the magnet, they came nearer and
nearer to a common center, the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>At a certain distance all paused. The night
was very nearly still. A faint breeze carried
the soaring sparks away from the tiny island
forest and out toward the water.</p>
<p>As the scores of craft came to rest they
formed a semi-circle.</p>
<p>It was strange. The quiet of the night, the
flames rushing silently upward. The light on
the water, the faces of two hundred people,
tense, motionless, lighted red by the flames.
And above it all a million stars.</p>
<p>Florence had seen something akin to this
pictured in a book. She searched her mind for
that picture and found it; a circle of gray
wolves sitting in a circle about a half burned-out
camp fire, beside which a lone wanderer
slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only these are not wolves,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;They are people, kind-hearted people. It is
the home of wolves that is going up in flames.
May they never return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they never will.&rdquo; She started at the
sound of a voice at her elbow. Unconsciously
she had spoken aloud. Tillie, who had slipped
up beside her in her rowboat, had answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not their island,&rdquo; Tillie explained.
&ldquo;They only leased it. Now they will not be
allowed to rebuild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should thank God for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Tillie replied frankly.</p>
<p>Once more there was silence.</p>
<p>Some time later Tillie spoke again. &ldquo;We
have her trunk, the lady cop&rsquo;s. You are goin&rsquo;
to-morrow. Will you take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe not,&rdquo; Florence said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t her true name. It will be safer
here. If I find her I will send for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that for a space of a full half hour
silence reigned supreme. Not a boat left that
unbroken circle. What held them there? There
was nothing they could do. What is the dread,
all-potent charm that holds a throng to the
scene of a fire until the last shingle has flared
up, the last rafter fallen? Does it hark back
to days when our ancestors knew no homes,
but slept by camp fires in the forest? Who
can say?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>As the last wall crumbled in and the chimney
came down with a crash, as if touched by
a magic wand the circle melted away into the
night.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Florence and Jeanne were
once more sleeping soundly. Such is the
boundless peace of youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIX</span>
<br />FADING SHORE LINES</h2>
<p>The following night found Florence
seated on the after deck of a large lake
steamer bound for Chicago. Strange and
varied were the thoughts and emotions that
stirred her soul as she watched the dark shoreline
of the North Peninsula fade in the
distance.</p>
<p>There was a moment when she sprang to
her feet and stretched her arms far out as she
cried, &ldquo;I want to go back! Oh, I want to
go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the woods and the water,
the sunsets, the moon at midnight, the fish,
all the wild forest creatures were calling her
back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Yet, even as this yearning passed, she felt
the smooth comfort of silk stockings, caught
the bright gleam of red and blue in her dress
and knew that here, too, was joy. In her
imagination she heard the rush and felt the
thrill of a great city, experienced again the
push and pull of it, and once more accepted
its challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am strong!&rdquo; she cried aloud. &ldquo;The summer,
this wild life, has renewed my powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jeanne? Ah, there was the question.
She had accepted a mission. She had agreed
to take the little French girl into the north
woods and see that she had rest. Had she
performed this mission well or ill?</p>
<p>To this question she could form no certain
answer. Life in this out-of-the-way place had
so pressed in upon her, adventure and mystery
had so completely taken possession of her,
that she had found too little time to think of
Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I have failed?&rdquo; Her heart sank.
&ldquo;What if the doctor says I have failed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was asleep in her stateroom. She
seemed well and happy, quite prepared for the
great testing which lay just before her. But
who could tell?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So often,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;we are
led away from the main purpose of our lives
by some surprising affair which springs
straight up before our eyes and for the moment
blinds us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, as she reviewed the events of the past
weeks she experienced few regrets. She had
been working, not for her own glory, but that
others might find success and happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what came of it all?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;What mysteries did we solve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problems that had perplexed her now
passed, like soldiers on parade, before her
mind&rsquo;s eye. Who had run them down and all
but drowned them on that first night? The
gamblers? The gypsies? Green Eyes and her
rich friends? She had found no answer.</p>
<p>Where were the three priceless rubies? Did
they lie among the ashes of the gamblers&rsquo; cottage?
Had the gamblers taken them when
they departed? Had the lady cop regained
possession of them? Where was the lady cop,
and what was her real name? Again no
answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>What of the lady cop&rsquo;s trunk? Why had the
gamblers turned the cabin upside down in
search of an empty trunk? How were Tillie
and she ever to return it now?</p>
<p>The problem that stood out in her mind
strongest of all was this: Who had taken them
for that terrible ride out into the night waters
of Lake Huron?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gamblers, to be sure!&rdquo; Tillie would
have said at once. It seemed probable that the
villagers thought the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps they burned the gamblers&rsquo;
cottage for that reason,&rdquo; she told herself. Yet,
of this there was no proof.</p>
<p>Turkey Trot and Jeanne had surprised gypsies
in a feast near Tillie&rsquo;s abandoned boat.
Jeanne believed these gypsies had taken them
on that all but fatal ride. Had they?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they did,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;they were
striking at Jeanne. They may strike again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclusion she reached at the end of
this review of affairs was that she must keep
a close watch on Petite Jeanne until the first
night&rsquo;s performance was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They kidnapped her on the eve of her other
great success,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;They may repeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, that was France. This is America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she rose and walked away to their
stateroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXX</span>
<br />THEIR CROWDED HOUR</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s one big night was at
hand. Already the shadows were growing
long in her modest little sitting room. To-night,
for one brief hour at least, she was to be
an actress. How the thought thrilled her! An
actress for an hour. And then?</p>
<p>True, she had acted once upon the stage of
the famous Paris Opera. But that was but a
fete, an affair of a single night. To-night much
was to be decided. Would the play go on?
Night after night would she dance the gypsy
tarantella under the stage moon? Would these
Americans applaud?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans,&rdquo; she said aloud, as she sat looking
away into the gathering darkness. &ldquo;After
all, how little I know about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Americans are like all the rest of the
world,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;They love laughter,
dancing and song. Then, too, they can feel a
pang of pity and shed a tear. Just dream that
you are on the stage of the Paris Opera, and
all will be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was not sure. She had suddenly
gone quite cold, and was not a little
afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green Eyes will be there. She hates me, I
fear,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the stage, when the great act comes,
there will be only Tico and you. The night,
the broken cannons and the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo; The little French girl sighed. &ldquo;I
must try to feel it and see it all as I felt and
saw it, a small child in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In half an hour we must go to the theatre,&rdquo;
said Florence. &ldquo;We will have a cup of tea, as
we did sometimes when we were in our cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we were there now,&rdquo; sighed the little
French girl. &ldquo;Oh, why must we be ambitious?
Why do we struggle so for success
and yet more success, when peace awaits us
in some quiet place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>To this Florence found no answer. She rose
to turn on the electric plate for tea, when the
telephone rang.</p>
<p>She went to answer it. Petite Jeanne heard
her answer the telephone, but paid no attention
to her conversation until she caught the
word gypsy. Then she sat straight up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must meet her to-night?&rdquo; Florence was
saying. &ldquo;A gypsy woman? But that is quite
impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is being taken to Canada to-night by
the officials, you say? But how can it be necessary
for me to see a gypsy? I know no gypsies.
Besides, I can see no one to-night. Believe
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words were broken in upon by Petite
Jeanne. &ldquo;If it is a gypsy, you must see her!&rdquo;
The little French girl was pulling at her arm
impulsively. &ldquo;It is important. It must be. Besides,
gypsies, they are my friends. You must
remain here. I will go to the theatre alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One look at Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s tense face told
Florence that she had no choice in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see her,&rdquo; she spoke into the telephone.
&ldquo;Send her over at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>They drank their tea in silence. The night
was too full of portent for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsy?&rdquo; Florence thought. &ldquo;What can she
want of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she thought of those gypsies they had
seen in the north country. Had they made
their way to Chicago? That was not impossible.
And if they had, what did this woman
have to tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me one thing.&rdquo; Petite Jeanne suddenly
leaned toward her. &ldquo;Bring that gypsy
woman to the play. She is French. She knows
the tarantella. She has known war, as it was
in France. I will dance for her. She will understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Florence replied solemnly.</p>
<p>The moment for Jeanne&rsquo;s departure arrived.
Florence saw her carefully packed into the car
sent from the theatre, then she returned to her
room to wait.</p>
<p>With Jeanne gone, the place seemed
strangely still. The clock ticked solemnly.
From somewhere in the distance a fire siren
set up a mournful wail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is too much for me,&rdquo; she whispered,
speaking of Jeanne. &ldquo;Think of her forcing me
to remain here to meet a ragged gypsy, and
this the night of all nights. And then I must
bring that strange person to her show her
first night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door. She sprang
up to open it. A man stood there, not a
woman. For a moment she did not see the
woman behind him in the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I am an
immigration officer. This woman and her
companions entered our country without permission.
We found them in the west side settlement.
They must return to Canada. This
woman insisted upon seeing you.&rdquo; He pushed
the short, brown woman into the light.</p>
<p>Instantly the girl recognized her, and
gasped. She was the mother of the beautiful
child that had so narrowly escaped drowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to see me?&rdquo; she asked as soon
as she gained possession of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You good. You kind. You not bad.
Gypsy not forget. I must tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Mystified, Florence motioned her to a seat.</p>
<p>The tale the woman had to tell was a long
one, and passing strange. In her broken
tongue, with many repetitions, it was long in
the telling.</p>
<p>And all the time the clock was ticking away
the moments. Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s great hour approached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXI</span>
<br />PETITE JEANNE&rsquo;S DARK HOUR</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne reached the theatre.
She was quite alone. She entered at the
stage door unnoticed. A chill numbed her being
as the shadowy hallway leading to the
dressing rooms engulfed her.</p>
<p>The past ten days, as she reviewed them
now, seemed a bad dream. Rehearsals had
been carried to the last degree of rigor. The
director had been tireless and exacting. On
her return the physician had pronounced her
physically perfect; yet, at this moment her
knees seemed ready to cave in beneath her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first night!&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
How often, in the last few days, she had heard
those words. Experienced actors who had
known many &ldquo;first nights&rdquo; and many failures
as well, spoke them in whispers. Inexperienced
youngsters shouted them. As for
Jeanne, no one had heard these words fall
from her lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So much depends upon to-night,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Success or failure. And who does
not wish to succeed grandly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain was down, the stage deserted,
as she paused in the wings before going to her
dressing room, where Tico, curled up in a
warm corner, awaited her.</p>
<p>Many times she had stared up into the dark
rows of empty seats as she did her dance. In
her mind&rsquo;s eye she could see them even now.
But now, too, she caught the rustle of programs.
The seats were filling, filling with
Americans&mdash;to her the great unknown. In
wild panic she fled to her dressing room.</p>
<p>The place was bare, barn-like. Only Tico
greeted her. It was cruel that Florence could
not be here now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she will come,&rdquo; she assured herself, as
a feeling of great hope surged through her
being. &ldquo;They will be there in the audience, she
and the gypsy woman. I will see them. They
will give me much courage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>As she changed to her stage costume, a
great peace stole over her. But this was not
for long.</p>
<p>The sound of the orchestra&rsquo;s opening number
sent fresh chills up her spine. What was
she to do? How could she find fresh courage
for this hour? No answer came.</p>
<p>The curtain went up. Then, amid such a
hush as she had never before experienced, she
tremblingly took her place on the stage. The
scene was a French gypsy camp, for the play
told of gypsy life during the World War.</p>
<p>Fortunately her part in the first act, also
in the second, was small. She sat unobtrusively
beside the bear in her corner, or moved
silently to the side of the ancient gypsy fortune
teller.</p>
<p>The story of the gypsies during that war is
a fascinating one. Their young men volunteered.
They died as bravely as any other
true Frenchmen. The older ones, the women
and children, wandered here, there, everywhere,
enduring the suffering and privation
that had fallen upon the land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>In the story of this play, at its beginning,
like Cinderella, Petite Jeanne, a diminutive figure,
was held in the background. Marie Condelli,
a fascinating dark-eyed gypsy girl,
dressed in many bright silk skirts, took the
front of the stage. It was she for whom feasts
were arranged, she with whom a great American
officer fell madly in love on the very day
before his heroic death on the battlefield, she
who was the very darling of gypsy camp and
war camp alike.</p>
<p>One night, so the play ran in its second act,
the two girls, the dark-eyed one and Petite
Jeanne, sat at the feet of the fortune teller
when that aged person spread her arms wide
as she cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see a vision. It is a battlefield. Many are
dying. A great officer is wounded. He falls.
He is a father. She, his child, comes to him.
It is a girl, a young woman. She bends over
him. I see her face. Now I do not see it. But
yes. It is Marie. No, it is little Jeanne. No! No!
It is one. Which is it? My God, the vision is
gone!&rdquo; She falls to the earth in a spasm.
When she comes to herself, the two girls implore
her to tell them the truth. Had she seen
one? Had it been the other? For both Marie
and Petite Jeanne had been brought up like
orphans in the gypsy camp. It had been rumored
that one of these was stolen as a babe
from a great French family. But which? No
one knew.</p>
<p>Such is the story of that drama up to the
great third act in which Petite Jeanne was to
emerge from her obscurity and play an important
role.</p>
<p>One fact we have not mentioned. Early in
this play, it is revealed that Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s
gypsy lover has gone to war, and is believed
to have been killed.</p>
<p>All during the first act, and again through
the second, Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes strayed to one spot,
to the seats that had been allotted to Florence
and any friend she might care to bring. Always
the seats were unoccupied. At each fresh
disappointment her despair deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they not come?&rdquo; she asked herself
over and over. &ldquo;They must! They <i>must</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXII</span>
<br />PETITE JEANNE&rsquo;S TRIUMPH</h2>
<p>The tale the gypsy woman had to tell was
as astonishing as it was fascinating. As
we have said, told in her halting speech, it
was long. Florence&rsquo;s face showed her consternation
as she looked at her watch when it
was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried, seizing the woman&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;We must go to the theatre at once!
We will miss some. We must not miss all.
It is the first big night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started and all but screamed as a man
loomed before her. The officer! She had quite
forgotten him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tricks!&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;She must start
for Canada to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she must go with me first.&rdquo; Florence
was quick in recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tricks,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None at all. You may go with us. Only&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated, &ldquo;we have but two seats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bent a steady look upon her. &ldquo;You
look all right. I&rsquo;ll meet you at the box office
after the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank&mdash;thanks! But we must rush!&rdquo;
Florence was halfway out of the door.</p>
<p>Down the stairs they raced, then round
the corner to a taxi stand.</p>
<p>Only once they paused before reaching the
theatre. Leaping from the taxi, Florence
dashed into a telegraph office. There she sent
the following message to Sun-Tan Tillie at her
home in the north woods:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bring the trunk at once. Your expenses will
be paid.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On returning to the taxi, she murmured,
more to herself than to the gypsy woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they were in that trunk all the time!
How perfectly marvelous!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>A moment later the taxi came to a grinding
stop before the theatre. Here they were,
at last.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At that moment Petite Jeanne sat in a dark
corner backstage, engulfed in despair. The
curtain was down. The scene shifters were
preparing for the great third act. The orchestra
could be heard faintly. Her zero hour was
at hand.</p>
<p>Thus far, the play had gone well. Its fate
now lay in her hands. The big scene, the gypsy
dance on a battlefield under the moon,
would decide all.</p>
<p>And to Petite Jeanne at that moment all
seemed lost. &ldquo;If only they were my own
French people,&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>At that moment all the hateful acts performed
by her people against visiting Americans
since the war, passed through her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How they must hate us!&rdquo; she thought in
deep despair. &ldquo;And they know I am French.
These Americans. They are so tremendous in
their approval, so terrible in their disapproval!
How can I dance before them? If only Florence
and that gypsy woman were here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment of sheer despair, a hand was
laid upon her shoulder. A voice spoke to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, sister!&rdquo; the voice said. &ldquo;You are
going to be a wonder! Only forget them all,
and dance as you danced that night in the
forest beneath a real moon. That was
heavenly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little French girl started in astonishment.
She found herself looking up into the
peculiar greenish eyes of the stage star she
had thought of as her enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you saw?&rdquo; Her eyes were filled with
wonder. &ldquo;And you do not hate me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Hate you? I am your sister of the
stage. Your success is the success of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s mind whirled. Then her
thoughts cleared. She stood up straight and
strong. She planted one kiss on the cheek of
Green Eyes, shed one hot tear, then she was
gone.</p>
<p>A few moments later, in the hush of moonlight,
with a great throng looking down upon
them, she and Tico appeared upon the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>In this act, as the play runs, the dark-eyed
rival of the girl portrayed by Jeanne discovers
her father, a great French officer who has
lived unknown to his daughter for years, only
to find that he is dying.</p>
<p>The light-haired gypsy comes upon the
scene to find the other girl in her dying father&rsquo;s
embrace, thus to learn that her hope of finding
as a father some noble Frenchman is dashed
to the ground.</p>
<p>Downhearted, despairing, her lover gone,
hopes vanished, she remains with bowed head
while the dying officer is carried away. Then,
as her bear&rsquo;s nose touches her hand, she remembers
her art, the art of dancing. In this
art she finds solace.</p>
<p>Moving gracefully into the dance, Petite
Jeanne danced as she had never danced before.
One pair of eyes in all that vast audience inspired
her most. Gypsy eyes they were, the
eyes of a stranger who had belonged to the
camps of her enemy in France, but who, in a
strange land, had become her friend. Florence
and the strange gypsy had arrived in
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The spell woven over the audience at that
hour was sheer magic. The moonlight, the
battlefield with its broken cannons; all this,
with the bewitching dance of the tarantella,
held the throng breathless, spellbound.</p>
<p>Then, at the dramatic moment, a soldier appeared.
He was dressed in the uniform of a
French poilu, but his face was the face of a
gypsy.</p>
<p>He stood motionless, entranced, till the
dance was done. Then, with a cry of joy, he
clasped Petite Jeanne to his heart. He was
her long lost lover.</p>
<p>To crown all, there comes from the distance
a sound of shouting. Jeanne lifts her head to
listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asks hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; There is the joy of heaven in her
lover&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;That is the armistice. The war
is over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, like the roar of a pent-up
torrent, applause from those silent walls of
humanity broke loose. Never before in the
history of the theatre had there been such
acclaim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne took curtain after curtain.
She dragged forth her rival and her lover, all
the cast. At last, quite exhausted, she fled to
her dressing room, where she found Florence
and the faithful Tico awaiting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence!&rdquo; Her voice broke as she
threw herself into her boon companion&rsquo;s
arms. &ldquo;These Americans! They are so very
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down deep in our hearts we love the
French as we love no other people.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s
tone was solemn. &ldquo;Two millions of our
boys have lived in your villages. They shared
your homes. They ate at your tables. They
know how brave and generous the French
people are. How could they help loving them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh, Jeanne!&rdquo; Her voice rose to a high
tremolo. &ldquo;I know all! All that we wish to
know about those mysterious affairs of the
north country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; implored the little French girl.
&ldquo;You shall not tell me now. We must escape.
We will go to our room. There we will have
coffee and some most wonderful wafers, and
we shall talk until it is day. Is this not the
way of actors? And I am an actress now!&rdquo;
She laughed a merry laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;you are a very great
actress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tico and I are very great,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne
laughed again, for at that moment she was
the happiest girl in the world.</p>
<p>One moment that wild enthusiasm lasted;
then again came desire to know, to hear the
answers to many sealed secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let us tell secrets by the
light of a candle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>
<br />FAST WORK</h2>
<p>In the meantime, in the far-away Northland,
there was great commotion within one
small cottage. Tillie had received Florence&rsquo;s
message. She had read it over twice before
showing it to her father and to Turkey Trot.</p>
<p>At last she read it aloud: &ldquo;Bring the trunk
at once. Your expenses will be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trunk does she mean?&rdquo; her father
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trunk we foolishly took from the lady
cop&rsquo;s cottage last summer,&rdquo; Tillie replied, and
groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh, father!&rdquo; she cried a moment later,
&ldquo;I must go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Without a word her father disappeared
through a door. He reappeared a moment
later holding a well-worn leather bag. In it
were their summer&rsquo;s savings. He counted out
some soiled bills. &ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d pay it back,&rdquo;
was his quiet comment. &ldquo;Such folks don&rsquo;t
often go back on their word. Here&rsquo;s the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turkey,&rdquo; he addressed himself next to his
son, &ldquo;you hitch old Billy to the stone-boat and
go after the trunk. We&rsquo;ll get Mike Donovan
to drive Tillie over to the station. If we hurry,
there&rsquo;ll be just about time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it happened that an excited girl stepped
from the train in mid-afternoon of the next
day in the great city of Chicago. This was
Tillie. She had wired ahead to Florence, who
was there to meet her. They clasped each
other tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got it?&rdquo; Florence asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trunk? I have. Here&rsquo;s the check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! It&rsquo;s fearfully important and too
mysterious for words. Let&rsquo;s go after it at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>They were some little time in finding the
baggage room in the large depot. When they
did there was a crowd waiting and they were
obliged to stand in line. To such a pair of
eager spirits these waits seemed endless. But
at last their time came. With trembling fingers
Florence handed over the check. The
agent disappeared with it. After some little
delay he returned. The check was in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;Not here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in,&rdquo; Florence voiced her disappointment.
&ldquo;It was on the Copper Express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Copper Express!&rdquo; The man seemed
puzzled. &ldquo;What sort of a trunk? That baggage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a strange thing happened. Gripping
Florence&rsquo;s arm hard, Tillie exclaimed in
a shrill whisper, &ldquo;Look! There goes the
trunk! That young man has it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence could not believe her ears. She
did not doubt the testimony of her eyes. The
mystery trunk was fast disappearing down a
passageway that led to the street. It was on
a strange young man&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He is stealing it!
We must not let him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>After that things happened so rapidly that
there was no time to call for aid. They dashed
away after the thief. They found him dumping
the trunk into the back of a low-built, high
power automobile. Another young man was
seated at the wheel. With a sudden leap of
the heart, Florence recognized this young
man. He was the one Tillie had pitched so
unceremoniously into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you,&rdquo; she cried, seizing the trunk
stealer by the shoulder and whirling him
about, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s our trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken completely by surprise, the man did
not act at once. It was well, for when he did
come to his senses, he flashed an automatic.
A second too late. He saw his gun whirl into
space as Florence launched her full one hundred
and sixty pounds against his chest. He
went down in a heap.</p>
<p>His companion, attempting to come to his
aid, found himself expertly tripped by the versatile
Tillie. The next instant, like some
jaguar, she was at his throat and he heard
her hiss: &ldquo;Now we got you. You gamblin&rsquo;,
robbin&rsquo; kidnapper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>It was fortunate for the girls that they were
not obliged to hold their poses long. Half
a dozen coppers arrived in time to give them
aid, and assured them that matters would be
adjusted in court at the proper time.</p>
<p>An investigation revealed the astonishing
fact that the slick crooks had learned in some
way, perhaps through Florence&rsquo;s telegram,
that the trunk was on the way. They had
boarded the train at an up-state station, forged
a check for the trunk and claimed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They nearly got it that time,&rdquo; Florence
sighed as two red-caps tumbled the trunk into
a waiting taxi and she and Tillie whirled away.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take it to Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s apartment.
It will be safe enough there. The gypsy told us
where we could find the lady cop. We have located
her. She and the &lsquo;poor little rich girl&rsquo;
will be with us at Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s show to-night.
After that we will go to the apartment
and have the formal opening of the trunk.
Won&rsquo;t that give us a thrill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it, though?&rdquo; Tillie bobbed up and
down in her excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those young men we just caught,&rdquo; Florence
said after a time, &ldquo;were the last of the
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A band of gamblers and thieves the law has
been after for a long time. Through information
provided by our gypsy friend, the others
were taken to-day. They will not be bothering
the kindly people of your settlement for some
time to come. There is enough chalked up
against them to last half a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; replied Tillie thoughtfully,
&ldquo;that I should feel sorry for them. But I just
can&rsquo;t. They went too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two miles too far,&rdquo; agreed Florence,
recalling their heart-breaking swim in the cold
night waters of Lake Huron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>
<br />THE TREASURE CHEST</h2>
<p>That night, just as the clock was striking
twelve, an interesting company
gathered in Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s parlor. The lady
cop was there. So, too, was Sun-Tan Tillie.
Minus her faded bathing suit, looking quite
stunning in a new dress of dark green, her
big eyes shining with interest, Tillie sat in a
corner. Close beside her was the &ldquo;poor little
rich girl,&rdquo; who once had pledged her parents&rsquo;
rubies, and lost. She knew Tillie and, without
having the least notion what it was all about,
had come at her request. Petite Jeanne and
Florence completed the company.</p>
<p>A tale was to be told. Secrets, they hoped,
were to be revealed. With her taste for the
dramatic, Petite Jeanne had insisted that the
affair be carried off in the grand manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>Electric lights were off. Shades were down.
Four flickering candles furnished faint illumination
for the room. On the very center of the
rug rested the mysterious oriental trunk
which had caused many a palpitation of the
heart. It gave off a pungent odor of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get it?&rdquo; the lady cop exclaimed,
on seeing it. &ldquo;When I learned that
the gamblers did not take it on their flight,
I gave it up. Thought it was burned in their
cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence held up a hand. It had been
Jeanne&rsquo;s decree that she should tell the story.
&ldquo;You will remember,&rdquo; Florence began, &ldquo;that
it was my good fortune to be permitted to
pour a few quarts of water from the lungs of
a gypsy child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, you saved her life,&rdquo; suggested
the lady cop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that. The gypsies are a
loyal and grateful people. I have always
known that. From the time I saved her child&rsquo;s
life, that gypsy mother had it in mind to repay
the service. She has done it. Three nights ago
she told me the answer to the riddles that have
vexed our minds and lost us sleep. Yes, she
even told me where I would find the three
oriental rubies, which were so unfairly taken
from Miss Erie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the rubies!&rdquo; The Erie girl sprang to
her feet.</p>
<p>Tillie pulled her down. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>At that moment Florence felt her heart sink
to her shoes. What if, for once, the uncanny
knowledge of the gypsy woman had failed?
What if the three rubies were, after all, irrevocably
lost?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The die is cast,&rdquo; she told herself sternly.
&ldquo;I must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will recall,&rdquo; she said, turning to the
lady cop, &ldquo;that on the night when we first
entered your cabin we, Petite Jeanne and I,
had just had our rowboat swamped by some
reckless, or willfully wicked people in a speed
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady cop nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You thought they had been after you. I
thought it was the reckless prank of some rich
young people. You were right. The boat was
driven by one of the younger gamblers. His
pal and two gypsies were on board. They suspected
you; meant to drown you. They got us
instead. And that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; Florence sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the trunk.&rdquo; Everyone moved forward.
&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; she cautioned. &ldquo;I am going to
account for its presence here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought&mdash;&rdquo; again she turned to the
lady cop, &ldquo;that the gamblers got your trunk.
They meant to. They were a few hours late.
Tillie and I got it the night before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; There was incredulity in the lady
cop&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s once when a prank turned out well,&rdquo;
Florence smiled. &ldquo;Tillie and I meant to fill it
with balsam tips and return it. We have. See!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw up the lid of the trunk, and at
once the air of the room was heavy with the
natural perfume of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kept the trunk till now,&rdquo; she said
quietly. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we come to our big night, Tillie&rsquo;s
and mine, the night we were kidnapped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this instance there were three possibilities.
It might have been a prank indulged in
by reckless young people. The gamblers may
have done it, or the gypsies. Tillie thought it
was the work of the gamblers. Because she
came upon a gypsy feast that night, Jeanne
blamed the gypsies. They were both right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time the two rather striking young
gypsy girls had learned who Jeanne was. They
had hated her in France. They hated her still.
They could not get at her. She stayed in the
cabin. They proposed to take out their spite
on her friends. The gamblers hated Tillie.
They combined forces and prepared to show
us a rough time. Well,&rdquo; she ended grimly,
&ldquo;they succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After cutting our boat loose, they came
ashore to prepare a meal and eat it. It was
this feast that Jeanne&rsquo;s bear interrupted. They
fled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And all this,&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne, coming
out from among pillows in a dark corner, &ldquo;goes
to prove that we owe a most humble apology
to my beloved Green Eyes and to her friends
of the Erie cottage. We suspected you of
pranks which were quite impossible for you
to perform.&rdquo; She spoke the last to Miss Erie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite all right!&rdquo; The rich girl&rsquo;s
tone was friendly. &ldquo;We do not expect to be
entirely understood. We were taught by my
father when we were very young that to take
advantage of others because of wealth or power
is the act of a coward. That there are such
rich cowards, one can&rsquo;t deny. We hope they
are very few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne beamed her thanks for this speech.
&ldquo;But, Florence!&rdquo; she cried suddenly. &ldquo;This
does not explain the green eyes I saw in the
deserted lumber camp that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must work out your own solution for
that.&rdquo; Again Florence smiled. &ldquo;Some wild
creature was hiding there, or you were having
a case of nerves. Our gypsy friend knew a
surprising lot. She did not know everything.
No more could she tell what caused the fire on
Gamblers&rsquo; Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but the rubies!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Erie,
as the story seemed about to end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Florence, true to Jeanne&rsquo;s dramatic
conception, &ldquo;is to be the last touch. According
to our gypsy friend&rsquo;s story the three
rubies are supposed to have been hidden in
some secret pocket of this ancient trunk, and
there they should be still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trunk!&rdquo; &ldquo;The trunk!&rdquo; &ldquo;Trunk!&rdquo; came
from the lips of Tillie, the lady cop and the
Erie girl all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now proceed to find out.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s
voice took on a business-like tone.
&ldquo;Jeanne, a blanket. We&rsquo;ll dump these balsam
tips in it and tie up the corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the trunk seemed empty, all crowded
around.</p>
<p>Lighted only by candles, Florence began
prodding and thumping with a chisel until at
last she brought forth a hollow sound. A section
of the trunk&rsquo;s false bottom was pried up,
and then they started back. For, in that dim
light, small eyes appeared to gleam up at them.</p>
<p>The spell lasted for but a moment. Then
Florence&rsquo;s hand went down and came out full
of gems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A regular treasure chest!&rdquo; There was awe
in the lady cop&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>The next instant she had taken something
from beneath her coat and was pinning it on
Florence&rsquo;s breast. It was her detective badge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;that is where it
belongs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; The girl removed the badge and
returned it to its place. &ldquo;I had all the luck. It
will be quite different in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said the lady cop quite soberly.</p>
<p>The trunk proved to be the hiding place for
a noteworthy collection of gems. The police
had taken it in a raid and, quite ignorant of its
value, had sold it. Some of the jewels were
returned to their rightful owners. Several remained
unclaimed. So Florence, Petite Jeanne,
Tillie, and the lady cop are all richer by a
jewel or two; while the &ldquo;poor little rich girl&rdquo;
regained her standing in her family by returning
the much prized bauble to its place in the
collection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>The gypsy drama, with Petite Jeanne playing
a leading role, enjoyed a long run. In the
meantime, Florence was not idle. Fresh adventures
came to her. Was the lady cop one
of her companions? Was Petite Jeanne? Was
Tillie? Did Betty come back? You will find
the answer to all these questions in our next
book, to be entitled <i>The Golden Circle</i>.</p>
